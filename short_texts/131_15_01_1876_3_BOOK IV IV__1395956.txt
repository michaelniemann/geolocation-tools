 CHAPTER IV. 

 Extracted from t7tc Diary of the Rev. James North. 

 AuODST 21 -Theie has been but one entry in mi journ ii since the 30th June, und that but to record the advent of our new Commandant, wlio as I expected, waa Captain Mnuiico Freie 

 So gi eat havo been the changes which base Ukeu place, that I scarcely know how to rccoid them Captniu Trero has realised my worst anticipations He 13 brutal, vindictive, and domineering His knowledge of prisons and prisoners gises lum nu advantage over Buifcess, otherwise ho much resembles tint mindel out animal Ho has but one thought-to keep the pnsoucrs in suljcction So long as the island is quiet, ho cares not whether the men In0 or die "I �as Bent down here to keep order, ' said he to mc a few dijs after his arm ni, "and by God, sir, 111 do it ' 

 Ho has done it, I luust admit, but at n cost of a legacy of li itred to himself that ho inaj some d ly regret to havo earned Ho has organ ised three parties of police One pitiols the fields, one ison guard at stores uni public build nigs, and the thn d is employ ed as a detective force There are two liundied soldiers on tho island, and tho omcei in chaine, Cnptun M Nab, has been induced by licie to mci ease their duties m uiauyssajs The cords of discipline aie suddenly di awn t%ht Foi the disouler which prevailed when 1 landed, Ti ere has sub stituted a budden and excessive rigor Any officer found gis mg the smallest piece of tobacco to a prisoner is liable to 1 euios al f 1 om the island The tobacco which giows wilu has been rooted up and destroj eel lest the men Bhould obtain n leaf of it Hie pus llego of having a pannikin of hot water svhen the giugs carne m from field labor in the es cning has been ss ithdraw n Tho shepherds, hut keepers, and all othei prison�s, whether at the Btations of Longridge or the Cas- cades (where the 1 uc,li�h consicts aie stationed), are forbidden to keep a pal rot or any othei hu c1 '1 he plaiting of sti ins hats din lug thu piisoners' leisure hours is also prohibited At the settle mentsshere the "old hands'aie located titled boundaries have boen erected, beyond which no prisoner dare pas� unless to vsoik Two days igo, lob Dodd, a ne0ro, lot his j icket fall os ei the boundary nils, cros'-ed them toi ecos er it, and was severely flogged The flogcangB aio hideously frequent On dogging moi ninga I base seen tho giound svheie the men stood �it the triangles saturated ssith blood, as if a bucket of blood had been spilled on it, eos enng a Bpace three feet ni diameter, and running out 111 sanous directions, in little streams tisooi tlneo feet long At the same time, let me s ij, with that strict justice I f iree mjhclf to mete out to those whom I dislike, tint the lshud is ma condition of abject tublnisBion Thero l8 not much chance of mutiny The men go to their work without a murmur, and sliuk to their dormitoiles like whipped hounds to kennel Iho gaols and solitary (I) cells are ciosvdcd ssith prisoners, and each day sees f 1 tsh sentences for fresh crimes It is cunio here to do nnj thing 

 but live 

 The method by sshtch Captain Trero has brought about this repuse of desol ition is chaiac tenstie of him He Bets on every man to be a spy upon his neighbor, ass es the moro darmg into obedienco by the displaj of a rufliainsin more outrageous than then own, and raising tho worst scoundrels 111 tho place to office, compels thom to find " cases for punishment Pel fidy is rewarded It has been made part t f a cons let policemans duty to search a fcllosv insouei anywhere and at any time This searching is often conducted in a w antonlj roucji mid dis 

 gustmg manner , and if resistance is offeied, the mau resisting can be knocked doss n by a blow from tho searcher s bludgeon Inquisitorial vigilance and lndisctimmatiug harshuets pievail everywhere, and the hsc3 of hundteds of prisoners aro reduced to a continual agony of terror and self loathing 

 " It is impossible, Captain rrero," said I, one daj, during the initiation of this sjstent, "to think that these villains whom you base lnado constables vsill do their duty " 

 Ho replied, '"Ihoy must do their duty If they aro indulgent to the prisoners, thoy know I shall Hog 'em If thej do what I tell em, they'll make themselves so h itcd that thos d lins e their ow n father up to tho triingles to sav e themscls es being sont back to the ranks " 

 " You treat them then like slave keepers of a wild beast den T hej must flog the animals to avoid being flogged themselves " 

 " Ay, said he, ss lth his coarse laugh, " and having once llo^ged em, thoj d do nnj thing rather than be put 111 the cage, don t 3 0 Bec 1 

 It is horrible to think of this sort of logic being used by a man who bus a wife,and friends �nd enemies It is tho logic that the Keeper of tho Tormented would use, I should think I am sick unto death of the pi ice It makes me a 

 diBbchoser in the social charities It takes out 

 of penal scienco anything it may possess of nobility or worth It is ci uel, debasiug, mini 

 man
