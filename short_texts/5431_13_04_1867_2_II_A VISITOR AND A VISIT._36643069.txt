THE MAXWELLS OF BREMGARTEN, A STORY OF TASMANIA. [Founded on Facts.] (THE COPYRIGHT AND RIGHT OF TRANSLATION ARE RESERVED.) (Continued from last Saturday's issue.) CHAPTER II. A VISITOR AND A VISIT. THE voyage was more than usually mono- tonous, nothing having occurred to enliven its tedious length except a couple of ships spoken with at sea, and a distant glimpse of the South American coast. When Maxwell landed in Sydney he declared he had had enough of the sea to last him all his life. His health was, however, almost completely restored, and he felt as if entering upon a new existence, with a world of boundless and magnificent open before him. Mingled with his hopeful anticipations for the future were many mournful thoughts connected with the past. He had left, perhaps for ever, the dearly loved land of his birth; he had sepa- rated himself from relations and friends whom he might never see again; and had thrown up an employment of a respectable nature, to enter upon a speculation the issue of which might be extremely disastrous. He was a man of great depth of thought, and, as is generally the case with such men, was some times given to despondency; yet his mind was well tutored in the belief that he was under the protection of an all-wise Provi- dence who, as it is said in the proverb, would help him if he would only help him- self. The hurry and bustle of debarkation over, a lodging procured, and the luggage safely put away, our settler bethought himself of his letters of introduction. He took one to an eminent merchant of whose urbanity and liberal disposition he had heard a great deal, and was received with politeness, tempered with a fair proportion of ice. The merchant was a keen man of business, and as his busi- ness absorbed all his thoughts as well as dreams he had no leisure to throw away upon bearers of letters of introduction ; unless it was possible to drive with such bargains to personal advantage. He understood, he said listlessly, that it was Mr. Maxwell's intention to proceed into the country; he was sorry to say he knew nothing at all of the country, and could give him no information whatever. He evidently voted Maxwell's presence a bore, and bowed him out of doors with a be- nign smile. The settler was grieved, and making a sudden resolution never to deliver any more such letters, he packed up his re- maining stock with his card in each envelope, and dropped them into the post-office. After waiting in some anxiety for a couple of days le was pleased to find that even one out of the two dozen gentlemen to whom his letters were addressed, condescended to take some notice of him. This was a retired Indian officer, Colonel Arnott by name, who resided at a little distance from the city. He introduced himself with the honest bluntness of an old soldier, declaring that had he but known a few days sooner how Mr. Maxwell was situated he would have been on the spot to assist and advise to the best of his ability. "As it is," said the worthy old officer, " you can pack up your traps, leave them or bring them with you just as you like, and come out to my place for a few weeks until you decide what's to be done." "You are too good, Colonel," said Mrs. Maxwell, "a fanmily like ours would be too serious an invasion of your hospitable man- sion." "Not at all, my dear madam,"said the Colonel, "if I was not sincere I'd have said nothing. I have witnessed--aye, and also suffered in --far more desperate invasions; but I came not to bore you with military tactics. My manners ma'am are like my parts of speech, or I might say words of command�short, sharp, and decisive. You'll excuse me, but my house is heartily at your service; and my wife�a good soul�will be glad to see you : my son and daughter, too, will be so happy. Fine boys those of yours sir, and your daugh- ter a perfect lily of the valley as I live. We'll make men of those boys : which is the elder, for I see no difference?" "This boy, Colonel," replied Maxwell, pointing to Eugene, "is exactly fifteen minutes older than his brother." "O I see," said the Colonel with a chuckle, "That's the way to do it�nay my dear madam, no cause for blushing. Egad, I was a long time before I had even one, and then ten years before I had another, and in two years another, only three just like you; two at home, one up the country taking care of the sheep, though there could not be perhaps a more careless rascal to take care of any- thing." "If you will be so good, Colonel Arnott," said Maxwell, not wishing to hear any family disclosures, "as to give me a little informa- tion relative to the mode of proceeding to be adopted, I shall feel greatly indebted to you." " 'Pon my honor, sir," answered the old officer, "you'll excuse me�but information is a thing I never do give except in my own house, and after dinner. After dinner, sir, when the ladies are good enough to show us their backs�I beg ten millions of pardons ! when I crack my bottle of Burgundy as you can see by my nose, I'll give you more infor- mation than mayhap you'll be apt to relish. I'll put you up to a wrinkle or two that'll astonish you, depend on it. I am a rough old dog, sir, but I put on some restraint before the ladies; and if you don't promise to come to my house, the whole box and dice of you, I will just say this�if you ever pre- sume to speak to me again I'll call you a sneak, if it's in the presence of the Governor. What do you say ? Is it to be peace or war ?" " You cannot suppose, my dear sir," replied Maxwell, "that I am so foolish as to decline
