CHAPIEBIY. 

 weight was to be raised by lever or poUey, of singing ont 'Bowse her up, boys.' I nave carried it about with me, and osed it to con ceal my identity, -My real name is Egbert Howell, and my family owned, and I trust stm own, large estates, in West Virginia. Towards the close of the fifties our home was happy with the presence of fattier, mother, my Drother Wngh, and sisters *''^*^i Susan, and Lauretta, l was just home from West Point, full of fun and frolic, sad ready for all ir^P^ of mnwnrrTrt Mid *�'*�*'?'''�'*?? Among our friends, and not distant neighbours, wen a family of the name of Sheridan. Their estate was in the adjoining state of Maryland. GeoigB Sheridan and I had men school-fellows. He waa a year older than 'L, clever, versatile, good humoured, kind hearted,� each a friend at a man ahould prize. Much u I loved him, I loved hii sister Elmina more. He returned the sVMnpl i nsqn^ by Ainnji hu heart to my sister Lauretta. When I think on the happi ness of those youthful days, and gaze acroat the dreary past, no wonder I try to drown my sorrow. My attempts but whet the teeth ol remerse, which have sunk deep into my heart. At the period of which I speak, the conten tion between the northern and southern States of America, an the questions which led to the civil war, had began to agitate men'! minds. The Sheridans declared at once fa the abolition of slavery: my father's sympa. thus were all with the pro-slavery party. Be attended the meetings held, took an active part in politics, and guided public opinion it the distant. I was not so eager, because 3 cared not to cast ont with my friends. But as the content grew keen, feelings became ex cited, and the lines of division in soda] circles and even in families stood out clearly. At last the crisis came, and, urged by my father, I joined the mastering ranks of the southern army. My military training led to my being faimndiatrly entrusted with the com. maud of the Fifty-fifth Virginia. Association with men whose antagonism to the northern federation was bitter and uncompromising aroused my passions, and with tin heedless ardour of yooth, I plunged into the contest The populace was also eager, and full of sympathy. Well do I remember when march ing through Leesbarg, the day before Jack son's corps waded the Potomac at White'a Ford, an old lady standing by the wayside, with uplifted hands, and tears etreaminj; from her eyes, exclaiming ' The Lord bless your dirty, ragged souls.' I will not weary yon with the man-hing, fighting, retreating, and straggling in toe early years of the conflict. I come to the fighting, which took place in Maryland in 1882. The second defeat at Bull Bun, or Menassss Junction as it was diversely called by the contending forces, bad enabled Lee to transfer the theatre of operations from tile front of Bichmond to the front of Washington. Maryland was a divided state : the people were not to be trusted ; but when our regiment camped a mile from Amberga, where the Sheridans resided, I could not re sist the temptation of visiting the family. Had I not been known personally to one of the hone-keepers, I should have fared badly. Ele, s.t my jnsrujition, took me prisoner and led me before Mrs. Sheridan for disposal. So far the meeting was not pleasant. It was prevented becoming distinctly so by Elmins's tact and temper. With her my interview was sweet but sad ; aud when I felt the tears on her face as I kissed her, I could have stripped myself of my ragged grey uniform, and fled far from the conflict Bat the bogle call sounded in the distance, and I returned so far under escort to my comrades. On the 14th of September, 1862, in the year after my majority, was fought the battle of Cramptou'd Gap. General Howell Cobb had been directed to hold it to the last man ; against it mustered the forces of General Franklin, which included Newton's
