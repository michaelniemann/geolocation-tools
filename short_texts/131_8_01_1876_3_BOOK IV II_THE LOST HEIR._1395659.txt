 musing inTa calculation concerning a race, John C often wondered at the strange ease with ilticli he had earned out so monstrous and ;�mmgly difficult an imposture Landed in ^diiev by the vessel vi Inch Sarah Purfoy had satt to save bim, he found himself a slave to a bondage scarcely le� balling than that from which lie had escaped-tlio bondage of enforced r"m.anionship with ntl unlived woman The oniiortuno death of one f her usMgucd servants Md enabled Sarah Purfoj to m"lul tho esc iped Lonvictiu his room In the strange state of society which p evaded of necessity in Now South Wales at that period, it vv es not unusual for assigned servants t> many among the fiec settlers, and w heu it was lie ird that Mrs Purfoj, the widow of a whaling captain, had ni lined Juhn Cm, her storekeeper, tranipoited for embezzlement, and with two years of lus sentence yet to run, noone eipessed surprise Indeed, when, the jen after, lohn Carr blossomed as au " e\\piree, mastei of a fiue vvifo anda fine foi tune, theit were in ui} about lum who would h iv o made his omtence in Austiaha Tilt uaut enough But John Rex had no notion of remaining longei thau he could help, and ceaselessly sought means of escape fiom this second prison house 1 or a long time his seat eli was unsuccessful Much as she loved tho �cottudrcl, Sarah Purfoy did not scruple to tell lum that she had bought linn, and regudid linn as her property He knew that if he made any attempt to escape from his in u nage bonds, tho noniiu who hld risked so mu li to save linn would not hesitate to deh\\ ei lum ov er to tho authorities, and Btato how the oppot tuno death of fever stricken John Cul hid enabled her to give name and omploynient to absconded John Hex He had thought unto th it the fact of het being his wife would prevent her from giving evidenco against linn, and that ho could thus defy kel But she reminded lum that a word to Blunt would be all sufiicieiit

 powerful, and he could but wait until her death or some lucky accident would rid lum of hci, and leave lum flee to follow out the scheme ho had matured " Once ntl of her, he thought, in his solitary rides over the statten of which ho was the nominal owner, "and tho rest is easy I shall return to Engl uni with a plausible story of shipwreck, and shall doubtless bo received with open nrniB by tho dear motkei from whom I Im\\o been so long parted Richard Devino thill have his own aL/uu

 And so they would wrangle, she glor} ing m her power over the man who lind so long tu uinphed over her, and ho consoling himself with the hope that the da} was not f li distant which should bring lum at onco freedom and fortune Ouo daj tho chaueo carno to him His wife was ill, and tho ungrateful scoundrel stole five hundred pounds, mid taking two horses leichetl Sydney, and obtuued p is= igo in a vessel bouud

 Once �-scaped from tin aldom, he pioceedcl to play for the treat stako of his life with the utmost caution He went to tho Continent and 

 lived for weeks together m tho towns where Richard Devine might possibly have lestded, familial laing himself with streets, making the wqttamtauco of old inhabitants, di awing into his omi hands all loose ends of information which coull help to knit tho meshes of his net the closer Such loose ends vvero not numerous , ti� piodigal had been too poor, too insignificant, to leave strong mcmones behind htm Yet Re-v knew well by what strluge accidents the deceit of au assumed identity is often penetrated Some old comrade or companion of the lost hen intfelit suddenly appear with keen questions as to tlio memory of trifles which vvt uld cut his flimsy web to shreds, as easily as the swoitl of Sdulm divided the floating silk He could not afford to ignoiethe most lnsignifiemt cucum stances With consummate skill, piece by piece he built up the story which was to deceive tho poor mother, and to ni ike him possessor of one of the hugest private foi tunos m England 

 This vv is the tile he hit upon Ho li id been 'ived from the burning Hydaspes bv a vessel hound foi Rio Ignorant of tho death of Sir Richard, and prompted by the pride winch was known to be a leading feature of his character, he Ind determined net to return until fortune Miould have bestowed upon him wealth at le ist c nuil to tho inheritance from which he had been ousted lu Spanish America he-had Bh iv en to accumulate that wealth m vam As KIOHCIO, tru oller, speculator, sailor, ho had toiled for fourteen ye 1rs, and had f uled Worn out and I10"1'01}*, he had returned home to beg a corner of Lngliili earth m which to lay his weary bones Hie tale vvvs plausiblo enough, and at the telling of it ho was armed at all points There was little fear that the navigator of tho captured O Prey, the man who had lived in Chill aud 

 cut out cattle on the Currum Plains, would prove lacking in knowledge of riding, seaman snip, or Spanish customs Moreover, ho had determined upon a course of action which snowed his knowledge of human nature 

 the will undei which Richard Devino inherited 

 was dated in 1807, aad had been made evidently when the testator was m tho first hopeful glow ot paternity By its terms Lady Ellinor Dev me was to receive n life interest of �3000 a year m ner husband s property-which was placed m the tonus of two trustees-until her eldest son 

 ,, or attained the age of 25 years When ctmer of these events occurred, the property was V0iftn�^llaet1, u�y EUinor receiving a sum of �100,000, which, invested in Consols for her ueneat would, according to mercantile Sir monard s prudent calculation, exactly compen- sate for her loas of interest, the remainder going absolutely to the son if living, to his children or next of kin if dead Tho trustees appointed were Lady Elhnoi's father, Colonel 7T Wade and Mr Silas Quaid, of the firm ot I urkiss and Quaid, Thanes Inn, Sir Richard'B � *�ra Colonel Wade dying, appointed, with ijuaid s consent, hu own son, Mr. Francis Wade, i J Ia hla BteaJ When old bachelor Quaid lied, the firm of Pukiss and Quaid (represented in the Quaid branch of it by a smart London urea nephew) dec med farther responsibility , and, with the consent o� Lady Eilinor, Francis " fe continued alone m his trust Sir Richard'B �"ter and her husband Anthony Frere of unstol, were long ago dead, and, ns wo know, their representative, Maurice Frere, content at ia,t in the lot that fortune had sent him, had

 given up all thought ot meddling with his uncle's business- John Rex, therefore, in the person of the returned Richard, bad but two persons to satisfy, hu putative uncle, Mr Francis Wade, and hu putative mother, Lady 

 Elhnor Devine 

 Tina he found to be the easiest task possible Francis Wade was an invalid virtuoso, who detested business, and whose ambition waa to be known as a man of taste The I issesaor of a email independent income, he hid resided at North End ever since his father s death, and had succeeded in making the place a ?'Ort of nunn turo Strawberry Hill When he icceded to his Bisters urgent wish, and assumed the sole re sponsibihty of the estate, he put al! the floating capital into 3 per cents, and was e intent to see the interest accumulate. Lady Elisnor had never recov ered tho shock of the circumsUncea attend mg Sir Richards death, and, clinging to the belief in her eon's existence, chose to regard herself as tho mere guardian of his interests, ready to bo displaced at any moment by his sudden return The retired pan lived thus togethei, and spent in charity and btic librae about a fouith of their mutual income By both of thom tho return of tho wanderer was hailed with a positivo delight To the Lady Ellinor it meant the wonderful reahs ition of a life long hope which had becomo part of her nature To Francis Wade it meant the ble Bed relief from a responsibility which his simplicity ilways secretly loathed, tho responsibility of looking after another person s money 

 "I shall not thiuk of interfeiing with the arrangements which you have made, my dear uncle, bald Mr John Rex on the first night of his iception " It would bo most ungrateful in mo to do so My wants aro very few, and can easily be supplied I will seo your lawyers Bomo day and settle it ' 

 " See them at once, Richard, seo them at once I am no mun of business you know, but I think you will find all right ' 

 But Richard put off the visit from day to day He desired to have as little to do with lawyors na possible He had resolved upon his course of action He would get money from his mother fir lmuicdiito needs, and when that mother died he wuu d assert full rights " My rough life li is unfitted mo for draw mg rooms, dear mother, he said " Do not lot there be a display about my return Giv e me a corner to smoko my pipe and lam happy ' Lady Devine, vv lth a lov a\\� tender pity, for which John Rex could not alt gether account, consented, and " Mr Richaid noon carno to be regarded as a martyr to circumstances, a man conscious of his own imperfections, and one whose imperfections w ero therefore to be lightly dw elt upon So the re turned prodigal had his on n stiito of rooms, bia own servants, his own bank account, drank, smoked, and was merry 

 For five or six mouths ho thought himself in Paradise Then he began to find his life in Biitferably weary Tho burden of hypocrisy is very heavy to bear, and Ret was compelled to perpetually boar it His mother demanded all his time She hung upon his lips , �he made him repeat fifty times tho story of his vv inder ings She was nover tired of kissing linn, of weeping over him, of thanking him for tho "sacrifice he had made for her "We promised nev er to spenk of it more, Richard, ' tho poor 1 idy said one day, " but if my life long lov e can make atonement for the wrong I hav e done you -' " Hush, dearest mother, ' said John Rex, who did not in the least comprehend what it was all about, " Let us say no moro ' Lady Ellinor wept quietly for o while and then went away, leaving tho man w ho pretended to be her son much bewildered and a little frightened T here was somo secret between Lady Dev ino and her son the which he had not fathomed Tho mother did not again refer to it, und gaming courago as tho days went on, Rex gievv bold enough to forgot all fears 

 lu tho first stages of his deception he had been tur d and cautious Then tho soothing influence of comfort, �espect, and security carno upon linn and almost refined him He began to feel almost as ho had felt when Mr Lionel Ciofton was alive The sensation of being rainibtcie 1 unto by a loving woman, who kissed lum night uid morning, c illing him " son, '-of being regarded with admiration by rustics, w lth envy by respectable folk-of being deferred to lu all things-was novel and pleasing They were BO good to htm that he felt at times moro than half inclined to onfess all, and le ive his caso in tho hands of tho folk he had injured Yet-ho thought-such a course would bo absurd It would result in no I enefit to my one, Biinply m misery to himself Iho ti ne Richard Devine was bulled fithoms deep m tho gieedy ocean of convict discipline, and the waved of lnnuiiierible punishments w ishcd over linn John Re\\ Hittered himself that bo had u-iuipcd tho name of one who w is ni f ict no living mm, uid tint unless one could ribo ii oin the de id, Richaid Devine would never return t> accuse lum So II ittenng himself, he giadu lily became bolder, and bj slow degrees suffered bia true nature to appear He w as violent to the servants, cruel to dogs and horses, often w antonly coarse in speech and brutally regardless of the feelings of others Governed, like most women, solely by hei feelings, Lady Devino had nt first been prodigil of her affection to the man �ho believed to bo her injured son But his nsh acts of helfnliuess, his habits of grossness and �elf indulgence gradually disgusted her For some time she-poor woman-fought against this feeling endeavoring to overcome her in stincts of distaste, and arguing with herself that to thus permit II detestation of her unfortunate son to arise in her heart was almost criminal, but BIIC MHB at length forced to succumb 

 Tor the hist year or so, Mr Richard conducted himsolf with great propnetj, but as his circle of acqu untance became enlarged,and Ins confidence m lnni�elf increased, he now and then forgot the part he was playing One day Mr Richaid went out to pass the d ly with a sporting friend only too proud to see at his table so wealthy and vvondeifnl a man Mr Richard drank i good deal more than was good for him, and came home in a condition of disgusting drunkeunei-s I say disgusting, because Borne folk have tho art of getting drunk in a humorous method, that robs intoxication of half ita grossness A man of true gentlemanly instincts, when owning a brain not weakened by habitual indulgence, never displ ij s those instincts to better adv an tage til m when overtaken in his cups With John Ret, to be drunk was to bo himself-coarse and cruel i rancis Wado was aw av, and Lady Devine had retired for the iiiCjht, when the dogcart deposited " Mr Richard Tho virtuous butler porter, who opened the door, received a blow in the chest and a demand for " Brandy I The groom was cursed, and ordered to instant oblivion Mr Richard stumbled into the dining room-veiled m that dun light which the servants considered nece�sarj for a dining room which was as it were, "sitting up for its master-and ordered "More candles1' The candles were brought, aftes some delaj, and Mr Richard amused linn self by spilling their meltings upon the di pet "Let's have luminashonl he oneil, and climbing with muddy boots upon the costly chairs, scrap mg with his feet the polished table, attempted to fix tho wax in the silver sconces, with which the antiquarian tastes of Mr Francis Wade had 

 adorned the room 

 " You 11 break the table, Pir,' said the servant "D- the table . ' said Rex "Buy nother table What's table t'y ou � ' 

 " Oh, certainly, sir," replied the man 

 " Oh c crt'nly ' Why c ertn ly ? What do you know about it ? ' 

 " Oh, certainly not, sir," replied the man 

 " If I had-stockvv hip here-I make you-hie -skip I Whar'B brandy ! '

 "Have some ! Good brandy ! Send for ser vautsh aud have dance D you dance, Tomkins � 

 " No, Mr Richard " 

 " Then you shall dance now, Tomkms You li dance upon nothing one day, Tomkms I Here I Halloo I Mary ' Susan ' Janet f William I Hey I Halloo I ' And he began to shout and blas- pheme 

 "Dont you think it's time for bed, Mr Richard � ' one of the men ventured to suggest 

 "No1' roared the ox convict, emphatically, "I don't I I've gone to bed at daylight far too long We 11 have luminashon I I m master here Master everything Richard 'Vine's my name Isn't it, Tomkins, you villain ? ' 

 " Oh h h I Ye yes, Mr Richard "

There ain' t much I am't fly to Wait till the old woman's dead, Tomkins, and you Bball see 1 ' More swearing, and awful threats of what the inebriate would do when he was iii

 ' Lady Devine has gone to bed, Mr Richard," cries Tomkius, aghast, attempting to bar tho passage to the upper regions 

 " Then lets hw o her out o' bed," erics John Rex, plunging to the door
