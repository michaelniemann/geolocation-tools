 HOME AT STAN MORE. 

 Anthony Derrick expected his sister Amy to be very much imjiressed with the beauty 

 id maeiiificence of Stanmore, which was and maguificenc 

 a large handsome modern mansion. Mr. 

 Derrick had spared no expense in laying out the extensive pleasuregrounds, and, although he had no great taste in these things, he had 

 availed himself of the taste and skill of 

 others; and lawns and terraces and clumps of wood aud artificial lakes and rockeiics gave 

 a variety to what was originally a flat and j bare piece of ground, and also had the effect of making fifty acres look like a hundred. Amy did admire rural England exceedingly, of which she had now almost the first sight. The three miles' ride in an open carriage from the station to Stanmore gave her the idea that it would be all very beautiful in two or three months, hut at present the bleak east "wind whistled through leafless trees, and, 

 though the little grass that was to be seen J was green, it was not the time of the year j 

 for the enthusiastic admiration which | Anthony expected, and which, some weeks later, Amy expressed. He was not aware how her thoughts had been travelling to Branxholm during her journey, and how she was mentally writing to Allan, so he was surprised when, after having bestowed in sufficient praise on the mansion and grounds, she pointed to a plain substantial farm-house about three-quarters of a mile from Stanmore, and asked eagerly if that was not Mill 

 mount. 

 Anthony was disappointed, naturally dis appointed, that his new-found sister should 

 not have her whole eyes aud thoughts en- 1 grossed by his generosity and his importance; 

 and it was still more vexatious that her 

 curiosity was turned to the very people whom ; he was determined she should forget. Amy j saw the expression of his countenance, and I partly read it. _ 

 " Millmount is one of your farms, is it 

 not ?" The cloud cleared away a little. j 

 "Yes, it is; but not the largest or the i finest on the estate. That is it, rather too 

 near the Hall for the view, but the drawing- ? room looks to the south, and so do the , principal rooms, so it is less matter. The j Copelands are very decent p'eople in their j way; they are never behind in their rent, and that is the main thing with one's tenantry. But here we are. Amy," said Anthony, as the 

 carriage stopped at the end of a beautiful ; avenue of lime-trees; "this is your home." ! 

 There was no one of the family at the door , to meet them on their arrival, though the carriage had been sent to the station, and they must have been expected to arrive at that time. Amy had to undergo the un familiar gaze of liveried servants who opened the drawing-room door for her, and announced 

 her by name, while Anthony stayed to give j 

 some directions as to her luggage. 

 Edith Derrick rose when she saw Amy standing timidly at the door, went forward to meet her, and kissed her, hut the kiss was cold and indifferent; her aunt Anne contented herself with shaking hands as coldly with | the new comer, and asked her to sit by the lire, as no doubt she was half frozen with this long journey on such a wretched day. 

 " I should like to take off my wrappings first," said Amy, who really wished to get 

 out of the room. j 

 "I will ring for Parkes, the maid my 

 brother has engaged to wait upon you, to [ assist you with your toilet," said Edith. " I believe she will do, at least my Wilson says she thinks so." 

 To have a maid engaged for herself ex clusively was certainly very kind, hut when Amy had been conducted to the spacious and elegant bedroom by this smart young woman all the grandeur of her position could not 

 reconcile her to the idea that she was un welcome to her sister, and that it was veiy doubtful indeed if Edith would ever learn to j like lier. If Parkes saw her young mistress's I 

 agitation, she took 110 notice of it;�she only said something about the fatigue of a long 

 railway journey after a long voyage, and ! 

 asked if Miss Staunton had suffered from sea-sickness much, which seems to be the 

 only idea which inland countiy people have j on the subject of voyages. In a minute she 

 opened the trunk aud selected the dress for : her young mistress, excused its being a little 

 out of date on account of the distance- and 

 the wild sort of country that it had been | brought from, and modified it slightly with j 

 one or two touches to make it look more 1 

 modern, dressed her hair in the most approved | 

 fashion, and was satisfied with her success. Amy could not help being surprised at the style that had been given to her, and Parkes took stock of her young lady's capabilities as a lay figure, aud convinced herself that there would be uo difficulty in dressing her to look much better than Miss Derrick, and cutting Wilson out, although she gave herself 

 such airs. 

 It would have been plcasauter if a sister's hand had relieved her of her heavy cloak, and a sister's eyes and taste had directed the 

 operations, hut still if that was denied, it j was perhaps tranquillizing to have this long toilet performed by an absolute stranger, to 

 whom it was not necessary to speak much, ] and whom it was of comparatively little im portance whether she pleased or not. The dinner-gong sounded as the toilet was com plete, and Amy went hack to the drawing room as timidly as on her first entrance. 

 Her brother was pleased with her . appearance. Parkes had modernized her and improved her, and justified his selection of a maid; he took her in his arms and welcomed her to Stanmore Hall, and pointed out to her notice several pretty things in the room. He 

 took her ann, led her into the dinning-room, | and placed her at his right hand. Amy was J at first glad to see that there was no stranger, I and afterwards rather sorry, for any one j 

 would have been easier to talk to than the 

 three persons on whom her future comfort I and happiness were to depend. She felt | embarrassed by the presence of the grave domestics, and the solemn state of this quiet family dinner, which seemed as if it would never be done. Amy sat opposite to her sister, who watched her so that she felt nervous and awkward. It is not to he supposed that slie had faultless conventional manners, although at Branxholm they had appeared to be perfection. Had it not been for experiences in Adelaide, and on board the P. and 0. steamers, she would have been more ignorant and awkward still amidst the formalities of English dinner etiquette; hut on the present occasion she was so painfully anxious not to make blunders and not to offend that Edith and her aunt could not but observe her want of confidence and repose. 

 Anthony thought he ought to speak to Amy, and markedly to take notice of her, as he was piqued at the coldness of the others, aud saw that his half-hour's appeal 

 and remonstrance with them before dinner j 

 had been disregarded altogether. But there were few subjects on which he coiild talk to 

 his sister. Personal matters were too 

 ticklish ground, and general subjects seemed j out of place, so that conversation was very j 

 languidly kept up between them, and Edith and her aunt talked exclusively to each 

 other. 

 Amy was tired of the protracted dinner, and yet sorry when it was over and she was obliged to accompany the ladies to the draw ing-room without her brother's kind protect ing care. 

 "Do you play, Amy ?" asked Edith when they reached the drawing-room. 

 "A little," said Amy. 

 ""What teacher had you?" 

 "Mamma taught me first until she grew too weak, and then I had lessons from Mrs. Partridge in London. I never had any 

 lessons in Australia." 

 " Will you sit down and let us hear what you can do?" 

 "I will try, but do not expect much," said Amy, who knew that though her play ing had been thought splendid at Branxholm she had now more critical ears to satisfy. She j had natural good taste, and a correct ear, and a fine touch, but this did not satisfy 

 Edith. 

 " Nothing goes down now hut classical 

 music; you want the ground to be gone over j 

 again." 

 "Miss Staunton's playing is very like Lady Eveline's. Th.it surely is one of her pieces you played last," said Miss Derrick. 

 " I know it is very old-fashioned," said 

 Edith. 

 " I am sorry ^ know very little that is 

 newer. I have scarcely had any music but what mamma played." 

 "You do not want for talent," said Miss Derrick, " though you have not the execution nor have you had the thorough grounding 

 that Edith has had; but so many years have j 

 been lost." 

 " Do you draw?" asked Edith. 

 _ " -""fc ai all. I was to have learned; Mr.

 Hubbard was going to teach me, but when we left England 1 lost that opportunity." 

 " Do you speak Frencli?" 

 "Not very well. I understand it pretty ; 

 well." 

 "Italian?" 

 '' I know a little Italian." "German?" 

 " I had read Lessing's Fables on board 

 ship going out, but I could not go on by my- i 

 self." 

 " Oh dear.' and I suppose you are eighteen?" "No, not quite so old; only seventeen and a half," said Amy. 

 "A sad pity, is it not? Should you not j like to make up for lost time, and prosecute 

 some of those branches?" said Edith. 

 " Oh yes, very much indeed," said Amy, who felt greatly at a discount. How pre sumptuous it had been in her to accept the post of governess�of salaried governess�in honest Hugh Lindsay's household! "I should like to learn cveiything more thoroughly, hut 

 indeed I should not have been so backward if 

 I could have gone on, for I was learning so fast when " Here Amy stopped, for she had been told not to say anything about ber papa, and at the recollection of him, and of the sad day when she lost him, and her utter desolation when she sat by his body, Mrs. Hammond's cold contemptuous looks and ex pressions returned to her, and she felt that both her sister and Miss Dc "rick were of the same class. 

 There were some beautiful drawing-room books on the table, there were portfolios cf engravings, and pictures on the walls, and statuettes and ornaments of various descrip tions profusely scattered over the mantel shelves and occasional tables. Any one who had tact and feeling would have talked to the poor girl ou these subjects, and discovered by her remarks and her questions what capacity she had, hut these two ladies had no feeling for her, and very little tact in then- dealings With friends or acquaintances, so that this first interview was more like the reception of a new pupil by a somewhat exacting teacher than that of a sister to a new home. Amy shrunk from the catechising after a number of point blauk questions had been asked as to her attainments, and nervously took up a book, her father's favourite Tennyson, beautifully illustrated, and began to try to 

 read it. 

 " A great reader I suppose?" said Edith. 

 " No, not a very great reader; in fact lam not great in anything. I only want to creep through the world and offend nobody." 

 " That can scarcely he done if you are to hold the position in the world that Anthony expect^of you. He has such very exalted notions on the subject," said Edith. 

 " I surely heard some one play�not you, Edith," said the person spoken of as he en tered the room. "I suppose it was you, Amy?" 

 " Yes, Anthony, I played for a little." 

 " I liked it very much," said Anthony, " sit down again, and let me hear you." 

 The encouragement put fresh vigour into Amy's fingers, and she played better tban 

 before. 

 " This is very fine indeed, Amy. I never expected so much from you. It is quite an agreeable surprise to find, you have so much musical taste. Your touch is better tlian 

 Edith's in piano passages, and you are more accurate with regard to time. Edith will not condescend to pay sufficient attention to that, and it spoils her playing to my taste. Don't you like Amy's playing, aunt?" said Anthony, who really was fond of music and understood 

 it. 

 _ " It is veiy old fashioned," said Miss Der 

 rick. 

 " That can be remedied, for the fingers that play old music so well will do justice to new. I suppose you never touched such an instrument before." 

 "Never; it is a little stiff, but exqusite in tone," said Amy. 

 " Erard's best, and not six months old. I chose it myself out of twenty." 

 "The upright was the better instrument, Anthony," said Edith. " I cannot think why you choose a horizontal, contrary to my opinion and to Signor Masuccio's too." 

 " I chose one that suits my own taste and my own voice," said Anthony. " Do you sing, Amy?" 

 " Not at all, I have never been taught, but I should much like to Lear you sing and my 

 sister play." 

 Amy did not like to ysay "Edith," she could not call her "Miss Edith," hut this first use of the words "my sister" in the sister's presence was difficult. 

 "Then will you play an accompaniment for me, for Edith will not keep time? I look forward to you for this service in future." 

 " I fear I may not be able to play accom paniments as you like at sight," said Amy timidly. 

 Perhaps not, hut if I say, 'play this bar slower, or that passage quicker,' you will do it, or try to do it, which is what Edith will not do. She is one of those infallible people wbo are never in tbe wrong. I bope you are conscious of some small failings, Amy," said Antbony in an under tone, but one which was distinctly heard by the young lady of whom he spoke. 

 It was really the case that Amy did not play exactly to his liking at first, but she made no objection to trying again and again, and every fresh trial brought some improve ment; still it was not so agreeable or so in teresting to others as to themselves to observe the progress made. Amy turned round and saw the expression of weariness and im patience on her sister's face. " This practising should he kept for the morning," said she; " it is too had to inflict my blunders on such good judges of music." 

 " I don't consider that I am a worse judge of music than my aunt, or Edith, and I con sider that last attempt excellent. I wish you could sing, I am sure you must have a good voice, and your ear is excellent. I must hare you taught. Don't you think Amy has a very good idea of music, aunt?" 

 " She wants a little good instruction," said 

 Miss Derrick. 

 " I think it would be a very good thing for Amy to go to school for a year or two; there is no need to say how old she is, she might pass for sixteen�and Madame Lefevre could do something for her," said Edith. 

 " No, indeed, I am very much obliged to you for the proposal. Just when I am con 

 gratulating myself on gaining a dear little j sister, who is disposed to he a companion to me, you suggest that she should bo packed off to Madame Lefevre's, to have her natural 

 musical taste destroyed by your Signor ] 

 Masuccio aud her natural manners trans formed into those of a boarding-school miss. No, Amy shall have the best masters at home, hut she shall not he sent away for her education. Desides, Amy, though she may pass for sixteen, is really too old to go to school. She is quite a grown-up young lady who very probably has taken out her degree iu flirtation ou hoard ship. I believe that is a capital place to graduate iu. Is it, Amy";"' 

 " I don't know," said Amy blushing. 

 "You must he introduced to our aunt Lady Gower after you have had a little touch ing up, and she must introduce yon, as she has already brought out Edith. "We have 

 had a very quiet time since my grandfather's J death, but we may have a little gaiety now. Should you like to come out this season?" 

 "Oh! no, not yet;" said Amy, who was deeply impressed with her short-comings. 

 " I must spend at least one year under the , masters you were good enough to say I might 

 have." 

 " Then when you go to town with us you 

 will be in the shade, and there we can get \\ better masters than in this country place. We intend to go next month." 

 " I shall be so glad to see London again,' said Amy. 

 "There is no place like it after all," said i Anthony. 

 " It is not half so pleasant as Paris," said Edith. 

 "Paris is all very well," said Anthony. 

 "I should not mind it if there were no Frenchmen in it, but I thoroughly dislike the 

 French." 

 . " And I like tbcm extremely," said Editb. "I think their manners are so agreeable." 

 "That is one of the few points ou which Edith and I differ," said Anthony. "You will come to a knowledge of several more when you have been a week in the house. But, as she is always hacked up by aunt Anne, T expect you to side with me, so as to keep up the balance of power in tbe house." 

 " If you have to assent to every absurd j proposition wluch Anthony makes you will need to do it at the sacrifice of your under standing or of your sincerity," said Eilitb, " because he has had so little to amuse him 

 Lately, that ho finds a strange pleasure iu i differing from and contradicting me. Perhaps j singing to Amy's accompaniments, if not absolutely harmonious, may amuse you a little more than it amuses me and keep you from jangling with every one else in the estal dishment." 

 The Derricks had been accustomed to be ' 

 amused by their visitors, and, although Anthony would not acknowledge it to Edith, even be felt rather disappointed that poor timid little Amy, who was not allowed to talk about the things that she knew about and was interested in, had so little conversa 

 tion. 

 If Allan Lindsay had seen his poor girl in this splendid house, and heard Anthony tell her before he bade her good night that he was determined to give her every advantage, that her allowance for dress and pocket money should be equal to what Edith drew for that purpose, and that she should have ; her first quarter's money on the morrow�a j sum which astounded Amy to hear mentioned ' �lie would have thought his chance of her t return to Australia as his wife very small; 1 

 but if he had also known of the bitter tears 

 she shed, and the anxious sleepless night she spent, wliile she wondered how slie could 

 exist in this strange house, or steer her way | amongst this disunited family, Allan's hopes j would have come out again bright and j 

 strong.
