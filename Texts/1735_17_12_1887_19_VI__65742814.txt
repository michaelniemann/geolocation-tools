 ' He tuned to the left� is he sure of sight t There Qt a L^ifiouth/nliod bright' ^ plfB^nt summer afternoon in Bourke Street, Melbourne. The air is sunny and bright : the scene foil of life and interest. 

 On the side walks are ladies and gentlemen, dressed in the height of fashion, doing the block ; country people ia their best array, watching ' the passing show ; ' townspeople, m�T- and women, intent npon rtwl*- pumuts, hurrying alongTheedless of their fellows. In the broad Eboroughiare are vehicles of all Vin^w, from the merchant prince's pranonff bays, resplendent in silver-mounted liamees, to the selector's spring cart, and the rattling delivery van. Suddenly there is a commotion; shoots are heard ; there is the mad rat-tat of hoises' feet on the pavement, and the whiri of speeding wheels. As the vehicles Ul to the sides of the thoroughfare, in the lane formed by them is seen a waggonette, drawn by two bones, which have bolted. In the conveyance Bits a lady, very pale hot firm, with a little girl clinging to her in terror. The furious pace at which the horses dashed onwards, the position of the loose rains dragging between them, precluding the chance of any uue snatching them, forbode a fearful smash. As the vehicle passes the street fills np behind it with people, eager to seti the end of the race. Two policemen are knocked down in attempt ing to arrest the fugitives. A tail lithe man stands in the roadway ; the wheels seem to graze him. He seizes the rail of the waggon ette, and on the instant springs and swings himself on to the footstep. 'Sit still, madam,' he says encouragingly as he steps quickly into the front seat. Thence he passes on to the pole, balancing himself momen tarily, and holding by the harness of the galloping eteeds with one hand be reaches forward, and grasps the reins. He at once checks the horses, then stepping to the driver's seat, puts on the break, and brings them to a standstill. No�- the police oome up, the cab-driver appears, and there is the usual street crowd. The gentleman hands &e reins to His cabman, juA at once usjaii th� 

 oocmjsnls of the waggonette to alight Push ing uide some impertinent persons, he tsuurts them into an adjoining confectioner's where m glass of cool inter, and a little rest restores tile lady. As soon as she has recovered ?nffiiiwitly he calls another waggonette, and goes with her to the address given the driver. ' I would ask you to come in that my kuibtmd might thank you /or having saved oar lira, but he is not at home at present.' 'The pleasure of having done so is in toelf ample reward and thanks.' ' Ton mutt at least give me your card, that he and I may know to whom we are indebted for the safety of Elminaand myself.' ' Smlna� Hmina'- he repeated to himself. Caere may be something In a came, so I will give yon mine.' He handed a card with ' Mr William Blair' upon it. She looked at it and observed, 'It is quite new to me.' He Buned the hotel at iriiidj he was residing. She held oat her hand, repeated her expres ?ions of obligation, and they parted. As he waited away it occurred to him she had in a moment sf forgetfnlness probably failed to give him her name. There was something abont her which seemed familiar. He knew no lady like her, yet there was expression in her eyes which reminded him of someone � who, he could not recollect. Bnt he made a mental note of the address, and vent his way. Acrarding to expectation he met his old mate 'Old Bowser,' or Egbert Howell, as we may now designate him properly, on hiB return from a trip to New Zealand. In the evening after dinner they sat together in the hotel, talking. Blair had been relating to Howell the incidents connected with the reconciliation of Mr. and Mrs. Oocfaton, in which he was greatly inter ested. Be was bo delighted at the thought of their Captain �so clever at somethings, so useless at outers � having been taken possession of by a woman of capacity and ability. ' That is just what you need now, old man,' remarked Blair, laughingly. 'It would have done your heart good to hare seen how joyfully they were spending their new honeymoon together at Mount Elmina. Theyhaveacharm ing little girl, about whom Mrs. Macfarlane says herself she is ' daft,' and Mrs. Crichton Is a favorite all over the township. Now, what is the use of your knocking about in the way von have been doing, without any object in Ufa, when yon have it �n your power to make your friends happy � and someone happy above all the rest.' ' Welll have written to my sister, at last, telling .her of my good luck, and maHwg some sort of apology about my long silence, and in quiring about ill our friends.' 'When was that?' ' I wrote from Christchurch, and the letter should have reached her by this time.' ' Then von will go to America when yon receive her answer!'* Just tiion tile waiter mtnnnnJint^ a �enfj� man. to see Mx*. Blair, and presented a card which the Utter gUoced a*, remarking 'I (loot know the name.' Hie stronger who entered had a slight *toop, bnt he wbs a gentlemanly man of about forty. He bowed and u he m two gentlemen eaid� ' Mr. Blair!' ' Yes that is my name, bat I have no know ledge of yon, nor can I gneas your buainesB?' ' My wife hat pointed out to me I have a dnty to perform� and when a wife does that, p�HnFPt yon know it hi1* to be done.1* 'That is something I hare yet to learn '� was the JfeMng reply. **Tbe dnty I have to perform is to th&ok yon with all my .heart � inrXn^mg the large portion my wife has in keeping�for having M Seeing that I have also, I presume, saved that portion of your heart she has in keeping, thadntyl imagine ii not a disagreeable one.' 'I would rather not have had to perform It, and yet Tam pleased to do it Should the occasion occur again � which I hope it will not � you may calculate on my deepest grati tude for Buch services. If it be not con sidered an impertinence may I ask if ' our th&nlu cannot be expressed in a more substan tial mpTinT than in words f Mm. Sheridan begged me to ask your acceptance of a little trinket, which she h*s long worn, and which she thinks you may be pleased to accept. 'As he said eo, he produced a qnaintjy fa�hioned little golden sword and scabbard 'hanfnnc by a chain.' Blair looked at it, and pasting it to Howell for bis examination remarked that being doubtless the gift of a friend, be could not think of accepting it. * ' It would be quite sufficient for him to know be had been the means of rendering a : service to a lady who was not ungrateful.' Some more conversation followed, and the stranger having invited Blair to call upon him, left. During the interview, Howell had been sitting silent, bnt keenly observant of all that was passing. When the visitor bad gone be turned to Blair and said : � ' Do yon know I have been under a hallu cination all the time that man was here. At the first sound of his voice I thought I knew him, and as he went on his countenance, w)�iniw and bearing �1miwi. convinced me he was my old comrade whom I killed at Framp ton's Gap.' ' Oh the name most have suggested ouch a tiling. I am afraid you must be getting into one of your moody fits again. Where was the letter in reply to yours to be sent to? ' Melbourne Post Office.' 'Oh yon may never get eoch a missive � not for long at any rate. Start away home at once : no one will know yon at yonr old claim in Virginia ; you can look around, and if the prospect is not inviting, why you can rejoin me fxere again.' They were thus conversing, Howell sitting silent, lost in thought at intervals, when their recent visitor was announced. He entered in a state of great excitement, and advancing to Blair polled oat the little sword from its ?heath and said, 'Where did yon get that?' ? - 'BtolwAed is astonishment a.thfa inter rogator and replied,' 

 ?? Why It is the trinket of which you wished to make me a present I' ' No, not the sword. It is different. My wife's brother gave her the sword and sheath, bot she lost the original blade, and had to get ajiew one made, bnt it was not Buch a fine pieoe workmanship as the first. On looking at it on my return she finds the original blade restored, and the other one gone. Ton only can explain that, and Bhe implores yon to do 'Indeed I cannot, yon brought it here aid took it away again, I never saw it before ; you have bad ft since.*' ' This is mysterious. My wife and I are Americans, we hare come here from our home in Maryland, in search of health which has failed me somewhat since I got a sword passed through my chest ; and, more particularly, of my wife's brother, whom we fondly hope is alive somewhere in these colonies. He and I were friends, comrades, bnt when onr war broke out we took different sides, we met in his sword through me. I fell as dead, and be has been lost sight of since, tQl we heard from him some years ago, and recently that he had been seen and recognised on a mining field in the north. Do you know anything about him 7 Where did you get this sword ? ' My friend here may be able to give yon some information about such a person as you are in search of.' Mr. Sheridan turned to him, but ax he did so Howell sank on the floor. In the weak state of hiB nerves, after some recent indul gence, the effort necessary to control hw feel ings, while the revelations in which he was bo deeply interested were being made by his brother-m law, bad been too great for him. His system suffered from sudden prostration, and that night he was taken to one of the special wards in the City Hospital, delirious with fever. Three weeks after the events just narrated, Hie dim streaks of dawn were diffusing a soft light through the fever patients' room, wbe& in an eonally haOT and indistinct fashion light began to dispel Hie darkness which bad. clonded bis brain. He opened his eyes, and sitting near rite foot of his bed, was an angel in the form of tbe woman whom be bad loved 30 well twenty years ago. As he looked Bhe opened her eyes, they met his, and instantly she was kneeling at his side. He could not move he was so weak, but he felt warm tears upon ids hand, which she held in hers. He Looked longingly, lovingly, and with an effort uked � ' What does this mean f ' We have found you ; yon have been very ill ; now I am sure the fever has gone; be oniet and content, and you will be well again. !ake tiiis medicine and you will get rest.' He tried to move her band to bis lips. Quick to perceive hiB intention she bent over and gently kissed him. Later in the afternoon when he awoke again, his sister 'Eetta sat on the chair at his bedside. Her eyes were on him, and the in stant he awoke, she had her arms around his Deck, triwinp him for joy. Then she Bcoided herself for disturbing him, and summoned a nurse who bronght him food of which, prop ped up with ptfiotre. he partook ravenously. Jhen 'Retta told him a little of what had happened, Bmoothed his pillows, and urged him to sleep again. Bat be looked at her in Bnch a fashion, she �'il�*'i playfully, and ' Tea, she will be here presently.'' When Howell was well enough to be re moved, he waB fa lr �w to a charming fuDnshed residence his friends had Imnrri ttt the out skirts of Melbourne. - There, with the deli dons feelings that accompany recovery from Bore ^^'at', he waa mused, and waited on by tbose who were nearest and dearest to bun. Ufe became full of enjoyment of a kind such as he had thought he would never again realize. There be learned how George Sheri dan had recovered from the fierce eword throat of the 'reb.' captain, whom at the latest instant of the encounter he recognised ; how bis friends bad mourned for him, and yet not as for one dead. He also bad much to tell them of hia wanderings and adventures, and of tbe discovery of the Mount which he had named ' EHmiua,' for the sake of one wbo had always held her place in his heart. In the recollection and conversation upon inci dents of the old home-life in Maryland ; in the pleasant converse upon the accidents and incidents, which make np individual history, and go to form character, the union of their long divided lives was made complete. Willie Blair bad the dnty to perform of ^-*ti'g as groomsman to his old mate ; aad little 'ilina was intensely elated at having to assist as leading bridesmaid to her aunt. *4 I here is a mystery I have never been able to unravel,' remarked Mrs. 8heridan one evening, wnen they were all sitting chatting together. How did it come that the sword off my chatelaine disappeared, and the old sword, which I had lost, appeared on the occasion of George's first visit to you, Mr. Blair?' 'I think I could guess, but I have no doubt 'Bert will be able to explain.' ' Yes I think I could grass now too,' said Mrs. Howell. ' Had he it in his possession when George offered to make you a present of it?' 'Not I begin to Burmise,' exclaimed Mrs. Sheridan. 'But where could he get the old one which I had lost.' ' I found it after yon had got the new one, and meant to have given it you ; bnt just then I left borne, and took it as a keepsake.' ' Yes, that is what I guessed,' said Mrs. Howell. At first tbe newly-found friends gave little heed to the wealth Howell had acquired. It was the man not the money they bad been in search of, and having found him they were content. In talking over matters, however, it came out that the old home in West Virginia, parted with after the war, was open to purchase, and *Berfa heart yearned to return to it again. It was planned, .they should, bat before doing eo journey to Queens 

 land, and spend a week near the mining town of Mount fsbnina, guests of &e chainnaD and managing director of the Mount Elmina Gold Mininff - Company � Captain Crichton whose fine dwelling and estate were within a couple of miles of it Ihef had � pleasant tame there. Thence all went to Blab's estate on the coast where they were delighted with the salubrious climate, tbe beauty and variety of the scenery, and the capabilities of tbe country for maintaining a thrifty population. Time sped 'quickly, and that of parting came. The Howells and Shrrinann went sooth to Melbourne; Captain and Mrs. Crichton returned U- their home at Dnniron ; Blair made Us preparations for a visit to the land of his nativity� drawn thither by a longing Which he could not well explain to himself far less even to his dearest friends. Mrs. Criohton, now the sprigbtUest, wittiest, and kindest of women, rallied him about going away on another prospecting expedition, n which he might find something be could love better than gold. He shook his head doubtfully, yet hummed the air of an old Scotch Bung.
