NED KELLY THE BUSHRANGER IN ARMOUR. CHAPTER VI.  THE TURNING OF THE TABLES � KAROOA, TIE BLACK-TRACKER. Well, through the politeness and courtesy of the police superintendent, who vowed that he intended to serve under me on the present occasion, I found myself at the head of a dozen as fine follows as I could have picked up in a long day's march. And as the train began to move back towards Beechworth, we hurried on in a contrary direction, presently leaving the line and making a detour, hoping thus to be able to drop down on Ned Kelly and his gang ere they were up to the time of day. But the beggars weren't to be caught napping. They had already smelt a rat and made themselves scarce. I showed the superintendent how they had doctored the line, and he acknowledged that all aboard the train had had a wonderful preservation. I was much afraid that the blood-thirsty miscreants, on finding their scheme foiled (though how they had discovered it to be so I couldn't make out) had at once made off to carry out their devilish threat of setting fire to the shepherd's hut, and burning to death my unconscious comrades whom I had left therein. We hurried thither therefore, and found them all in safety, but in almost as prostrate a condition as I had left them, with the exception of Karoora, the black-tracker, who had come round all right, and was busy attempting to do what lay in his power for his companions. He greeted our arrival with intense delight. Well, we couldn't afford to lose precious time over the drugged ones, so we rolled them out into, the bush, and hid them away in the scrub, feeling as sure that they would come all right in few hours at the most as that they were perfectly useless to us for the present. This done, we set fire to the hut, so that it should not form a rallying place for the miscreants, and directly it began to blaze away I told Karoora that he would have to put us on the bushranger's track without delay. Of course we took him down to where the devilish work had been executed on the line, and there he nosed about and struck off the scent almost immediately.

SEIGE OF THE " BUNYIP" � THE BUSH RANGER IN ARMOUR. What ensued was so accurately reported in the columns of the "Mebournel Argus" and "Adelaide Observer" of Monday, the 28th June, 1880, that I can add. bit little to it. It was now one o'clock on Sunday morning, and the moonlight still brilliant. Two or three pistol shots from the upper windows of the hotel warned us to be cautious, and to dodge behind the tree trunks whilst we returned the fire. The first brush was exceedingly hot. Troopers and bushrangers blazed away at each other furiously, and we were only prevented from setting fire to the great wooden building, and burning the hornets' nest, by the knowledge that there were women and youngsters inside, for Polly had told me during our short interview of half-a-dozen hours ago, that two girl cousins were staying with her, as was also an aunt with three children. We soon had sufficient evidence of these being there, by the bushrangers holding up the little girls in their white nightdresses (and sweet pretty little dears they looked) in front of the windows, as shields to protect them from the fire. It was pitiful to see them writhe and twist in the terror of being shot, whilst their screams rent the air, and all the while their torturers blazed away at us, knowing well that their brutal ruse had tied our hands. We retired a bit in!o the bush, and consulted upon what was best to be done under the circumstances, but presently we heard the loud authoritative voice of Ned Kelly roaring out to us, and we advanced near enough to hear what he had to say. It was precious little, but it was terribly to the point for all that. Leaning out of the window, but holding one of the children so as to cover the whole of his front, he informed us in a speech which was liberally garnished with oaths, that unless we swore to give him and his men a quarter of an hour's grace to escape in, he would cut the throat of every woman and child in the place, and thereafter make of it a fiery tomb, rather than be taken alive. 

 I didn't think one of us doubted but that the villain would keep his word did we refuse his demand. I told him that we would give him an answer in five minutes, and then we retired into the bush again to consult. We were most of us wild with rage arid chagrin, for doubtless the bushrangers had their horses in the stables, and if we gave them the grace they asked for, their safe retreat would be secured. On the other hand, the murder of young girls and innocent little children was a terrible thing even to contemplate, though some amongst us declared that in any case the bushrangers would kill them, or worse, before they left, and that therefore we'd be fools to grant Kelly what he asked. Well, we were still arguing the matter, I being of course in favor of granting him his terms (for wasn't my darling girl there in the fiends' power ?) when suddenly we heard screams and shots, and rushing forward beheld to our joy that both girls and children had some way or other effected their escape. They were soon discerned running towards us, in their nightdresses. Some of the bushrangers had already discovered their flight, and had commenced to pop away at them with their revolvers, but the beasts had lost their beautiful and tender shields now, and we soon forced them to withdraw both heads and hands. A minute later my girl was locked in my arms. She told me with sobs that her father had been killed, and that it was one of the bushrangers, who more merciful than his companions, had connived at their escape. We had no time to say any more, but bidding them all make tracks for the village, keeping well out of pistol-range of the hotel meanwhile, we set ourselves with far lighter hearts than before to the stern task that was still before us, the destruction of the gang. And now the most astonishing circumstances occurred, for whilst we fancied we had all the ruffians in a trap, from which there was no escape except through the grim jaws of death we suddenly found ourselves attacked in the rear, by a man clad in long ulster and his face concealed by a black iron mask. He was only armed with a revolver, but he walked coolly from tree to tree, receiving the fire of half-a-dozen of us wheneve rhe was for a moment exposed, but blazing away quite correctly in turn, and doing far more damage than he received. It wasn't very long before I noticed two highly disagreeable things. One was that the rascal seemed especially bent on making me his victim, and the second that our balls appeared to strike and then recoil from his body. I therefore began to aim at his legs, and at my second shot he fell. I then rushed upon him, knocked his weapon from his hand, and tearing the iron mask from his face revealed the rage and agony-distorted features of Ned Kelly. He was encased in a bullet-proof armour that, as was afterwards proved had been manufactured from plough shares. Where he had kept this concealed, when he had put it on, and why single handed, are puzzles that none of us succeeded in solving. Perhaps he expected to come across Polly in rear of the trees, and make off with her; perchance he was only intent upon scoring vengeance against me. Whatever his object, the result was that it was I who both brought him down and then handcuffed him, and thus secured the entire two thousand pounds that were offered for his body alive or dead which two thousand pounds I paid into the Bank of Australasia to my credit after witnessing his execution. Well, we didn't relax our efforts against the hotel because the leader of the gang had fallen into our hands. We let Kelly lie where he had fallen it for his kneebone was so shattered that he was quite incapable of gaining his feet. All at once, however, and just as the day was beginning to break we saw flames dart out of the windows and through the shingle roofs of the "Bunyip Inn." Then we knew as plainly as though we had been told, that the survivors of the bushrangers had lighted their own funeral pyre, preferring to leave the world in that manner rather than through the friendly offices of Jack Ketch. It was impossible for us to avert their doom, for the inn was merely a weather board structure, tarred all over on the outside even to the roof. It burnt fiercely, illumining the neighbourhood for miles around. It was noon before we were able to enter the ruins, where we found the calcined skeletons of the twelve bushrangers, as well as that of the unfortunate landlord. By this time the railway had been set right by a party of navvies sent up a for the purpose from Beechworth, so that the very afternoon we carried Ned Kelly up a prisoner to Melbourne by the very train that he had hatched such a hideous device to wreck in order to get at the gold it carried. As I have related to you the wretch's end, you won't want to know anything about has trial or previous imprisonment. The five hundred pounds reward offered by the Government for the capture alive or dead of each of the bushrangers of Kelly's gang went to the dozen troopers who took part in the siege of the "Biunyip" (for no unworthy quibble was raised about their skeletons not being their bodies), and thus the Victorian Government paid in all eight thousand pounds for the destruction of this desperate gang of murderers, the most ferocious that the colony had ever known. And now one word in farewell. Next week pretty Polly and I hope to get married. [THE END.]
