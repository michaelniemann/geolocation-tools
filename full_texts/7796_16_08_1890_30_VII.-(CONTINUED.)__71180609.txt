 CHAPTER VII.-(CONTINUED.) 

 ' A full account of tho arrest, which it was stated took place at Dr. Hilston's private resi dence at an early hour that morning, was given. It was read with absorbing interest by the thou sands whose appetite for information on the sub ject had been whetted, rather than satisfied, by the accounts published m the morning. 

 What made the subject of greater interest to the majority of readers were tho allusions to tho recent marriage of tho accused, in which poor Maggie was referred to as " a fair young bride." Sa great, indeed, was the interest taken in tho circumstances surrounding tho death of Julia Crawford that the following telegram, published in the same papers, recoivcd but a passing 

 notice : 

 Total Wreck of the Susan Martin oil" Solitary 

 Island. 

 ALL HANDS DROWNED. 

 At an early hour thi� morninir it was discovered that a ship, Binoo ascertained to bo tho Susan Martin, a sailing vessol, on tho way from Rockhamp ton to Sydney, had Docomo a total wreck. It is bo lieved to have struok on ono ot a group of rocks not far from the entrance to tho port. A torriblo storm raged during the night, which accounts for tho faot that no cries of distross wore hoard at tho lifeboat station. Tho doad bodies of tho captain and fieveral of tho crow bavo boon rocovorcd. It is thought that they tried to roach tho shore in ono of the ship's boats. Strange to say, tho body of a woman was also found washed up on tho rooks, not far from that of tho captain. Thc ship had no accom modation for passengers, so it is supposed that his wife was with him. Tho woman's body has received very little injury, and is therefore capable of identifi cation. It is that of a woman about 30 years of ope, rather above modtum height, and of dark complexion. The coroner at Port Macquarie has benn telegraphed for ; and, ptnding his arrival to hold an inquost, the bodies will romain unburiod. 

 The telegram was headed " Solitary Island," and was sent from tho telegraph station on the Nambucca River on the adjoining mainland. 

 A paragraph subjoining the telegram gave a description of tho vessel, her tonnage, and the purposes tor which she traded between Rock hampton and Sydney. It is also stated that the captain, Jame3 Daniels, was a married man, whose wife resided at Rockhampton, but whether she had been on her way to Sydney or not, tho shipping agents were not able to say. Tho tele gram was dated for the preceding day. Its non receipt until Thursday was accounted for by the fact that the telegraph line, near tho scone of the disaster, had been damaged by tho storm, which had pr�vailed along tho coast for many miles. 

 This news was publishod in tho first editions of the. evening papers, and, owing to the excitement over Dr. Hilston's arrest, attracted much less attention than would otherwise have been the case. The same, however, could not be said for some additional information which appeared in later editions. In fact a perfect furore of excitement was created by it, and the second and third editions were bought up with such avidity that a fourth and afterwards a fifth edition was found necessary. This information appeared in the evening paper, from which I copy it, in the following form : 

 Tho Wreck of the Susan Martin. 

 A STRANGE DISCLOSURE. 

 THE BODY OF A FEMALE FOO ND NEAR THAT OF 

 THE CAPTAIN. 

 NOT THAT OF HIS WIFE. 

 Since our first edition was published some rather startling information rotative to tho above disaster has oome to hand. Tho shipping ngonts of tho ill fated vessel received a telegram lato this afternoon from Rockhampton, stating that Mrs. Daniels, the captain's wifo (or rather widow) is alive andv well, at that placo. This, in itself, is startling enough, but there is moro to follow. The polioe authorities wore informed of tho contents of the telegram, and it thon transpired that, their suspicions having already been excited, they had telegraphed for a foll description of tho body, clothes, �fcc, of the woman found at Solitary Island. To their utter astonishment, when tho answer carno, tho description was found to agree in every particular with that of Miss Julia Crawford, the lady who left Queensland, m the City of Brisbane, under the name of Miss Ferrers, and whoso tragic disappearance from that vessel has created so much exoitomont. 

 The question which now waits solution is how a passenger, who disappeared from a steamer about 

 8iX*o n?uea south of Brisbane, could bo washed ashore at Solitary Island in company with other bodies be tonging to the crew of the Susan Martin, duricg Wednesday night. The mystery of tho whole affair u further increased by tho fact that tho captain's log-book is missing, a most careful search of tho wrecked vessel and ita surroundings having failed to disoover it. It �B feared that tho captain, having �� il* W'*^ him *Q kis attempt to roach the shore, it has boon washed away by the onrrent into tho opon sea. So much im portance haa "naturally beon attached to tho ooourronce, and so certain aro tho police that tho body is identical with that of the ill-fated passenger by the City of Brisbane, that a telegram has been dis 8? p orderinB the body to bo sent to Sydney by the Grafton steamer, which will pass there to-nieht. 

 lt is probable, therefore, that tho hearing of the case for which Dr. Hilston is to appear on remand Defore the magisterial benoh to-morrow will be post poned pending the arrival of the body. 

 ?The case altogether is one of the strangest it has 

 wen our lot to chronicle. And weare convinced 

 y, SA ?d ^ ocoarred in the realmB of fiction, it would have been looked upon aa wildly improbable. � 19, however, simply another very striking illus tration of the truth of the saying that " Truth �B stranger than fiction." 

 In another paragraph in the same paper the tallowing additional information was given : 

 The FeiTcre-Crmvford Mystery. 

 nf1�!8 ,e^or*8 �* the police to discover the identity 

 ot the lady passenger lost from the City of Brisbane, wno (rave her name as Miss Ferrers, have been th0Wrf . ith suooeBB. What �B more,the information iney nave received seems to supply a possible BOIU nou of much of the mystery surrounding this strange rv � I &PDear8 that a lady, named Miss Julia crawford, suddenly disapneared from her"home, in a 

 suburb of thia, oity, about ton days ago. In appear ance she answered to the description given of the lady whose anppoRed death by drowning from the City of Brisbane bids fair to result in a cause celebre. Though her relatives were, up to the present, unable to dis cover ber actual whereabouts, they had reasonB for believing that ehe had gono to Queensland, lt has also transpired that the iady in question had been a former intimate acquaintance of Dr. Hilston. It is rumored that an attachment of a tender nature at one time existed between them-or, ia other words, that they had boen engaged to be married. If that is true, it certainly accounts for the appearance of the lady on board tho steamer, which was bringing Dr. Hilston and his bride to Sydney. In the in terests of justioa it is of tho utmost importance that the truth or falsity of tho rumor should be made manifest with as little delay as possible. 

 Frosh developments of this most remarkable caBe will, no doubt, bo eagerly looked for, and, in the ovont of any such reaching us during the course of tho evening, an extraordinary, containing it will be published and distributed in tho usual way.
