 CHAPTER I.-(CofcTiNUED.) 

 Ahl ye s, thia was better. There waa broad path of moonlight on the sea, the o was fresh, the breakers were booming < the coast. But, good heavens I was he look at this till 10 o'clook ? He cou not possibly go to bed till then. Ho awfully desolate the plaoe was. Why ( earth had he not sent for some < his books from Sydney as soon as 1 arrived at Woolingera P How horrid ever thing looked in the moonlight. � queer and unnatural. Was that a sturt or a rook on the grass ? He surely had m seen it by daylight. , He really began 

 feel quite queer, so he walked up quick] to the uncanny thing. A squeal-tom thing black started up, ran away, and the returning, leapt upon him. " Why, Giott poor old fellow, did I tread on your tail! The other half of the mysterious obje rose up too, and laughed, a pleasant, gir 

 ish laugh. 

 �� You nearly trod on me, too," she sail '� Couldn't 3 ou see what we were in tl moonlight?" 

 " Upon my word, I'm very sorry," e: claimed Diok. "I beg your pardon, 

 really couldn't see distinctly. In this cot founded moonlight it seems so bright, an yet one really can't see anything/' 

 " Oh, don't call it that," she said, rt proachfully. " It's eo lovely. Giotto an I were just saying we had never seen an j thing more beautiful." 

 "1 am sorry I disturbed your t�te-�-t�te, said Dick, gravely. 

 " Oh, no ; I'm not at all," sk e answered adding, "I was just wishing for you. 

 wanted Giotto to go and fetoh you, but h wouldn't." v 

 "Rather hard lines to expect him to di that," said Dick, smiling to himself, an< then he added, " I am much, flattered t< hear you were wishing for me. Can 1 d< anything for you ?" 

 " Yes," she said coaxingly, coming i little closer to him. " Will you?" 

 "Certainly, if I can," he said ; " but i would be too rash to promise before know ing what it is." 

 "Oh, it's very easy," she said, patting Giotto's head as she spoke. " Won't j ot take me across the sandhills to the lon� 

 beach? Giotto will come too." 

 "Oh, certainly; we'll go immediately after breakfast, if you like-or before." 

 �* But I want to go now 1" she ex 

 claimed. 

 "Oh!" said Dick, 

 " lt's so beautiful in the moonlight, and so cool. Please-1 don't know the way, you know." > 

 "But don't you think you will be tired, after your journey, you know? And one can see better by daylight." 

 " Oh no indeed, I shan't be tired. I love walking about, and I'm not a bit tired af ter the steamer. Mrs. Rowland is, but I'm 

 not." 

 " Well, you will want a shawl, or a hat, or something, ; and, hadn't 3 ou better ask 

 Mrs, Rowland?" 

 " Oh, no, indeed ; what do I want a shawl or a hat for? It's quite warm, and one doesn't want a shade from the moon. Ob, docomo! Don't you think it would be very nice ?" 

 " Charming, but I am afraid Mrs. Row land might-might be anxious about you if you don't tell her you are going." 

 " But I am sure she won't-why should she? Why don't you say you don't want to go, if you don't ? I hat J people not telling the truth." 

 " Oh, I beg your pardon," cried Dick, a little nettled. �. I am not given to telling untruths so as to get out of things. I am perfectly willing to go. I was merely thinking of you and of Mrs. Rowland. I daresay I should have gone for a stroll 

 myself, anyhow." 

 �.Oh well, that's right," she said, well pleased. "I'll answer for Mrs. Rowland, so-. Come along, Giotto ! Why did you give him that pretty name? I shouldn't have known how . .to pronounce it if. Thad only seen it on his collar j but : I heard you call him � Totto.'. -What does 'it mean?" Z]? 

 �* It's an Italian name. Ile was a painter you know, and an architect. I could/show 

 you photos of his campanileat Florence if I had my things here. On one of the panels at the base there's a eapital little bit of Soripture of a shepherd with his|sheep and dog." 

 "And is the dog like this dog?" she 

 asked with interest. 

 , >" Well no, he's another kind of dog; but a collie's a sheep dog, properly speak ing, though there are no sheep here ; and Giotto was a shepherd boy." 

 " And a painti r, too, and made a campa -what did jou call it P" 

 " A campanile-bell tower for the cathe 

 dral-all made of colored marble." 

 "And you have seen itP You were in 

 Florence?" 

 "Yea-take care of that stump. We shall be on the sand in a minute, and then it will bo easier walking. " Yes, I came through Italy from England-p'cked up 

 the steamer at Brindisi." 

 " Oh, fancy ! I do envy you ! ' she cried. "You have been in England, and seen Italy, come all that long way, and now you soe Australia 1 Oh, what a lot you must have seen I" 

 "One doesn't see much on a voyage," he said ; " but, of course," he added, mis chievously, " it is worth a thousand miles' journey to see the Aus ralian bush." 

 "Ah, now 5 ou are laughing I You don't really admire it at all. But you can't really have seen the beautiful bush-the scrub that never has been cut down and 

 spoiled. You mustn't talk about Aus tralian soenery till j ou have seen a great deal more." 

 " You are very patriotic," hazarded Dick. " . " Ob, I don't only love Australia because it is my, home. I only know one place in it, and just lately I have seen Brisbane, and travelled over the IUohmond and Tweed Riv� ra ; but really everything I have seen, was beautiful. And now I am going to Sydney." 

 " Indeed 1 How do you go-by sea ?" 

 /"Yes, we shall go from here. I have arranged to be there in April. Oh, isn't this sand delicious to walk in ?" 

 " I am glad youlike it. Hi, Giotto, here's a stick for you. Stupid fellow, can't you 

 find it P" 

 ** He doesn't care to," said the girl, laughing at the dog's wild race. " He likes the run best, not the stick." 

 " Oh, listen to the sea ; isn't it grand ?*' "Now you see the other beach," re marked Dick, for they had just reached the top of the sandhill ridge. 

 " Oh ! oh 1" cried the girl with a long breath, and then she suddenly started off to run down the slope, and did not stop till she stood on the shore beside the waves. Giotto, highly delighted, rushed after her, and snapped at her dress. Dick followed more leisurely. 

 u How on errth can you get so quickly over the sand?" he- asked when he stood beside her again. " And I don't know how you esoaped tripping over those stones and things." 

 " Did I go very quickly ?" she asked, " Oh, I like to run when l am very happy. 

 But sometimes Mrs. Rowland asks me not to. You don't mind my doing it, do jouP" . 

 " Not at all-f o long as y ou will excuse my keeping up the same pace." 

 " Oh, j ou are lazy 1 I expect you can run fast enough-men ought to be able to run faster than girls, oughtn't they ? Don't you ever run?" 

 " Oh, yes, if there's any occasion for it. I'll race you along the shore if you like," he added, yielding to a sudden impulse. If it was absurd or undignified, he had no time to repent, for scarcely wera the words out of his mouth before his companion cried, "One, two, three, andawf-yl" and started off over the firm smooth beach. 

 Dick followed, but being handicapped by Giotto's snapping at his heels and trousers did not overtake her till they had run some 

 distance. 

 " Oh, that was splendid," she gasped, 

 " but I am so out of breath 1" 

 " Sit down a bit," said Dick laughing, " on the sand. I say, listen to Giotto panting." 

 She threw herself on her back on the sand, and lay thero with her hands under her head. Dick sat down and began throw ing pebbles and sticks to excite Giotto Btill more, and wondered what wild thing they were going to do next. Whatever thia madcap proposed he felt reckless enough to fall in with now. But the dog's sharp barks and the booming and crashing of the waves were all the sounds heard for the next few minutes. Presently she spoke again, without stirrin g, looking straight up 

 overhead. 

 " What a long, long way away the stars are to-night," she said slowly. 

 " Farther t an usual ?" ask�d Dick flip pantly, looking round for another pebble. 

 " Yes, they Beem to be. My star is quite bright, though there ia moonlight, but it seems so far away. I wish it would be nearer," she added wistfully. 

 " Which is your star ?" he asked in a more serious tone, for she had spoken with something like a sigh. 

 " It is that beauty--no, I won't show you.. Ever sinoe I was quite little it has been my own star. I saw it so often from my window-I always thought it was my guardian angel looking at me, and now I never think of them apart." She paused a little, and then went on abruptly : " Oh, you can't think how different, how strange it ia to see it here !-with tho sea sounding, and the moonlight on the sand, and you sitting there. And I used, always, always to see it over the same placo, and it always set behind the same trees." She sat up and looked at him. " Do you know," she said, in a low voice, " sometimes I think the girl I was is still living at St. Joseph's, the same as ever, and I am tomebody quite different. I can hardly believe they are 

 both the same." 

 " You have had a great change in your life?" said Diok interrogatively. "One does feel like a different person in different 

 circumstances." 

 " I forgot 3 ou did not know,'* she said, " I have been at St. Joseph's-have you heard of it?-all my life." 

 " No, I don't know St. Joseph's. I am a stranger, you know. Where is it ?" 

 " In New England, not very far from Tenterfield. It is a big convent, you know. Oh no, I suppose you don't know. I don't think many people do know it really, but somehow I always expeot they do." 

 " And you have spent the whole of your life till now in one place-in a convent ?" 

 , " Yes." 

 " Wasn't it frightfully dull P" 

 " Oh, no, we were busy all day, and -- But now I am seeing the world 1 You see, my mother died, and she waa too proud to write to my father's relations about me. Besides, she had some money that she left me, and she put me iu the good mother's care. I was to stay with her till I was 18, and then I was to see the world. I might take the veil afterwards if I liked, or anything else I could, or I winted ; but first I was to see the world. Ltt us walk oh a bit," she added, suddenly, and sprang 

 to her feet. 

 " And is this seeing the world?" asked Dick, smiling inwardly, but outwardly grave. " Isn't it mostly inanimate world from Brisbane here ? But perhaps you 

 were Eome time in Brisbane ?" 

 " Only a month ; but I ara going to Sydney. I love seeing beautiful places, but I want to see people-people, orowds of people. I want to take to them too, and know them, find what they do and think I about. I want-" She opened her arms out wide, then raised them slowly behind her head. " I want," she said, and let! them drop to her sides, " to see every thing." - 

 " Everything must be interesting to you," observed Diok. " Look here, I think we had better walk back towards the houee. 

 It ia'getting late, you know." 

 They turned back in silence, she doing as he did, without appearing to notioe it, but the next oioment she gave a ory of pleasure. " Oh, look at this lovely little white stone. Isn't it white? Isn't it beautiful ?" 

 " Very," assented Dick. " Here's another. I expect you can find plenty a little higher up the beach if you want them." 

 "Don't," she cried, angrily, throwing away the one he offered her. " That's juBt like you people. Win never I say " How beautiful that ie,' you say quite calmly, ' Very pretty, but there are lots more.' It doesn't matter what it is-a sunset, a nice book, a concert-it's always the same. Why can't you enjoy a thing and love it for itself instead of always saying, * But you ought to see this?' or * Haye you heard 

 that other?' or-" 

 . She ended with a gesture of disgust and walked on quickly, her face turned away 

 from him towards the Bea. 

 " I'm sorry," he said. " I did not think it made one thing less beautiful if there were others like it. But I suppose things are not so new to ' us people ' as to 3 ou ; and perhaps we have to some extent lost the faculty of wonder and admiration." He gave a half eigh. 

 " It is like waking from a long Bleep," she said, answering only a part of what he said. "I am only beginning to live, 

 really live-no, I Lave scarcely begun yet 

 -I shall in Sydney." 

 .�Tho sleeping princess is waking from her 100 years' sleep," said Diok. " Where is your prince ?" 

 " It ia too late for a prince," she answered gaily, and with perfeot simplicity. � He waked her, you know, and I am awake already." 

 " Do you think you are ?" said Dick, under his breath, but aloud he said,� Well 

 where are you j.oiug?" �� Wei must cross' 

 the sandhills here to get home." 

 " It seems a pity to go in," she sighed, " but I suppose we must. Mrs. Rowland will be surprised when she finds I have had a walk. I raeitnt (o tit in my room and read, but the moonlight was so lovely I couldn't stay indoors. Don't let us go too fast. Oh, but I must run over this sand, it does feel so nice 1 You go slowly and then I can come back to you." 

 They were not long now in reaching Mw. Pattenden'e. Just as they wire getting near the house she asked suddenly, " Do you know what I am going to do in Sydney ?" 

 " See life, princess," he answered. 

 "Ah, but how? And what shall I �o in my lifo P Guesp.'' 

 " I couldn't, really. What is it?" 

 " I won't tell you-I'll tell you to-mor 

 row." 

 " Well, here we are. Who's that on the verandah P Oh-Lovely night, Miss King. 

 Yes; been for a stroll." 

 " Good-b; e till to-morrow then," said the girl, giving Lim ber hand. �.� Good-night, and thank you for taking me. Good-night, 

 Giotto, dear." 

 And she stooped down and kissed the dog's soft black head. 

 CHAPTER H. 

 Dick had some misgivings about that stroll. The girl bad evidently suggested it in all simplicity and ignorance of con ventionality, but he doubted whether Mrs. Rowland would look upon it in the same light. "But Low on earth could I help 

 itP" he said to himself. "-'How was I to tell that the girl was a fledgling from a convent ? Mrs. Rowland really can't blame me. If she blames anyone it should be herself for not looking after her charge better. But I hope she won't badger the poor girl about it, and make her self conscious and uncomfortable. It would be a pity to spoil such pretty innocence. No ; I believe Mrs. Rowland had too much good taste to say much. She is particular I am sure ; but I think she's sensible.'' 

 Ile came down rather late to breakfast next morning, and found most people finishing theirs. Mrs. Howland was taking hers in bed, but her joung fellow-traveller was bitting at table, talking eagerly to the Grafton lady about the Howers abe had found yesterday, asking their names, and comparing them with others she knew. When he entered she did not appear to notice him, but presently she was obliged 

 to look in his direotion. In answer to his 

 " Good morning ; I hope you are rested after your journey," she drew herself up a little, her eyebrows, contracted slightly, and she answered in the coldest of tones, " Yes, thank you," then turned to continue her conversation with her botanioal neigh bor. There was not the slightest si.n of embarrassment, but she appeared deeply 

 offended with him. 

 Mrs. Rowland's manner, when she appeared later in the day, was quite tte same as the evening before, dignified, but friendly. He made up his mind to say something to her by way of apology or explanation, as it seemed impossible to accost her companion ; but he scarcely saw anything of them during the day, and on the one occasion when he happened to be alone with Mrs. Rowland for a few minutes an absurd enough perplexity pre vented him from doing so. 

 He thought of broaching the subjeot by expressing a hope that the joung girl had not caught cold or been over-tired by her moonlight ramble, but thia politely foolish little remark waa barred by the difficulty of not knowing her name. He could not say, "I hope your niece," or your daughter, "did. not take cold," for there was evidently no such relation between the two. How could he say " your charge" or " your young friend?" And while he was puzzling his opportunity slipped away. Afterwards, of course, he thought of a hun dred neat ways to express himself-but, after all, what did it matter P He waa going away on Friday, and this was Sun day. Or what about the Tuesday boat? But it was better to do what one intended 

 and be bad intended to stay till Friday. "Well, he would see. 

 On Monday an expedition waa got up to pull acrosB the river in two boats and see the other head. It was a lovely day, clear, and not too hot. Nearly all the boarders went. On the other side they walked along the beach for a couple of miles to the " First Bluff," a cliff, grass grown on the top, from which a fine view 

 of the coast was to be had. The MisseB King tried in vain to get Dick Devereux to walk and talk with them. He strode alone in moody silence, wishing heartily he had not come. Even Mrs. Rowland's polite common-places annoyed him ; and he thought if Yamba waa dull, Iluka was unbearable. The girl, whose name he had not yet discovered, still shunned him, and the only thing that amused him during 

 that tedious walk was that he once over 

 heard Mrs. Rowland say, " My dear child, pray don't behave in such a marked way," to which the girl replied, " Why mayn't I 

 behave as I feel ?" 

 They looked at the view from the top of the Bluff, then went down on to the beach to rest under the shade of the cliff and And some shelter before going back. Dick went a little way off on the beach and walked up and down smoking. After a while some one passed bim and began gathering phelia a little beyond him. Giotto ran up to the kneeling figure and poked his nose amongst the shells. She laughed and talked to bim caressingly. Diok strode after his dog. 

 "May I help you gathering. shells, 

 Miss ?" he asked. 

 She did not help him out with her name. She darted at him one indignant glance, and then replied, still on her knees on the sand, " No thank you, � don't want your help." 

 " Have I done anything to offend you?" asked Dick, bluntly. 

 "No," she answered, rising immediately and looking straight at.'him. " You have not offended me, but I am angry with you." 

 , " Why, what have I done?" 

 " You went with me to the beach that night and you knew it wasn't right. I didn't know, but you did, and you might have told me." 

 "Oh, is that it? And how do you know now that it wasn't right ? who said 

 it wasn't?" 

 " Mrs. Rowland, of course. I told her what a beautiful walk I had had and I thought she would be pleased, and she looked horrified and said I mustn't do it again, and-and-and it's all your fault. Why didn't you tell me ? I think it is mean to take advantage of me because I don't know what people do in the world." 

 Her eyes flashed, but her voice trembled and tears were not far away. 

 "I'm awfully sorry, 1 am indeed," said Dick, sinoerely. It came over him how abominable it must be for girls to be taken to task for suoh things, and ordered how to behave. 

 She looked up, softened. " But why did you do it then ?" she asked. " Don't you 

 think it was unkind?" 

 " Bui you must remember," he rejoined, " that I didn't know you. For all I knew you might have been a fashionable society girl, better up in the ways of the world than I am myself. Besides, plenty of girls would do more startling things than that, and only be pleased if they did shock other people." Seeing she looked per plexed, h.e went on : " Don't you see it would have been very rude of me to sug gest that you were proposing anything un becoming ? It isn't as if it were a question of right and wrong, it is only what people think, and they think so differently." 

 " I don't . quite understand it," she 

 said. 

 " Well, don't mind,' said Dick. ��Be-j 

 lie ve me, it's only a matter of custom, and you will soon enough get to know what's oustom and what isn't. The rules have their meaning, and in time you'll get to know that, too. I promise you not to do anything again that Mrs. Rowland would disapprove of. Will that do ? Come ! say you forgive me, and won't shun me like a plague any more. Won't you P" 

 She raised her eyes, and looked search ingly into his. He returned the gaze steadily. Then she put her hand into 

 his. 

 " I. don't understand," she said ; �' but I don't think it matters. I am sorry I was angry with you." .
