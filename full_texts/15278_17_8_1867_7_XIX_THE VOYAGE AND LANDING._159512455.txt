 Chapter XIX. 

 THE VOYAGE AND LANDING. 

 Unfortunately there were no passengers from Adelaide to King George's Sound except Amy, so that she had only the society of the captain, the mail agent, and stewardess for the five days of the first part of the long voyage. They were all as polite and attentive to the young lady as possible, hut she was very sick and felt very solitary in spite of their attentions ; and she was not quite sure that she had done right in leaviug Branxholm and poor dear Allan, whose sad and affectionate "Good-by, dearest Amy, may God bless you," rang in her ears long after all the little compliments she liau. received in Adelaide had subsided to 

 nothing. 

 Miss Staunton's history and Miss Staunton's beauty had won upon the commander of the branch steamer, and he recommended her very particularly to the care of the captain of the ocean steamer, which was met at King George's Sound, and wished her a pleasant voyage and a happy meeting with 

 .her relatives. So the last tie with South 

 Australia was snapped and she was now fairly amongst strangers. She had recollec tions far from pleasant of her outward voyage, in an indifferent ship with a discourteous captain and disagreeable fellow passengers ; and was a little dismayed to find that she must share the cabin of an absolute stranger as far as Galle, and probably for the whole voyage. But the companion turned out to be a young girl, rather younger than herself, Sydney-born, whose mother had been dead for some years, and who was going to England with her papa, partly for pleasure and partly for educational advantages. Mr. 

 Porter was a pleasant-mannered good-" nature! old gentleman, who had been successful as a Sydney merchant, and who thought his health would be the better for a holiday. 

 Amy grew rather fond of Leonora Porter, and found the voyage more agreeable as it went on and she became acquainted with her fellow passengers. Although Leonora was young she had had some ex 

 perience in love affairs, and perhaps that was one reason why her father had taken her home, to delay her marrying and settling. There had been nothing serious, but there might have been if not checked in the bud. Leonora's confidence was fully given to Amy, and she thought Amy was close to tell her nothing in return ; but Allan's attachment was too serious to be talked of lightly. 

 At Galle the passengers had one day to see the wonderful tropical vegetation and cultivation, so different from that of Austra lia�where coolie labour works for European capital; and then the Australian passengers were transhipped into a still larger steamer, where all those from various parts of India and from China were to be their companions for the rest of the way. Leonora Porter was surprised and annoyed to see that the Indiana kept rather aloof from the Aus tralians, as if they considered themselves to be of a different grade. She and her father had held the first rank in New South Wales, and she expected to meet with consideration everywhere, and especially in a steamer. The old 'Sydney settlers, when they have kept clear of any intermixture with convicts, are the most aristocratic in feeling of all the Australian colonists, for, wherever there is a class essentially and irretrievably lower than another in a community, the caste feeling of the superior class will be strong. Whether the inferior class consists of slaves, as in America, or of an inferior race, as iu India, or of convicts, as in New South Wales and Tasmania, there is'a degree of exclusiveness and self-assertion among the governing part of the community. But the aristocracy of TtiHia feel suspicious of the aristocracy of New South Wales, and indeed look down on Australians generally, and the Anglo-Indians 

 on board tbe P. and O. steamers like to show 

 off a little, so that though Mr. Porter from Sydney, Mr. Harding from Melbourne, and Mr. Warren from Hobart Town were more 

 intelligent, wealthier, and much better mannered, to inferiors at least, than the officers and civilians from the Indian Presi 

 dencies, they did not receive either from captains or officers or stewards the attention and consideration which was freely given to the Anglo-Indians. 

 Leonora Porter and Amy Staunton were, however, the only young ladies on board, although there were many young married women going home to England to recruit their health after a few years of married life. They looked elegant, though worn and thin and sallow; whereas the Australian girls were in the bloom of youth, and had a degree 

 of animation and readiness in conversation 

 which their invalid fellow passengers might despise but could not rival, and even the heat never seemed to make them languid or 

 out of humour. 

 Leonora Porter fought many a hard battle for her country with the Anglo-Indians. Amy was not Australiau-born, likelier, and could not be expected to be so enthusiastic ; but Leonora would not allow that there was 

 any imperfection to be seen in New South Wales. The glorious harbour, the beautiful Government Domain, the princely city of Sydney, the delightful society, the boating parties, the picnics, the excursions, the parties, and balls were all extolled with the enthusiasm of a girl who spoke of her home. Whether Sydney was so much preferable to the Indian cities in which the other ladies had spent some years Amy was not quite sure, but there was not the same attachment on their side. They never had had any idea of living their lives there ; and, though their marriages might have been happy, they had not been domesticated in their foreign home as Amy had been at Branxholm. 

 It was a new life to Amy, and she hoped it was a good preparation for what was before her. Idleness was the rule for all; nobody seemed to need to make the least exertion, and they appeared to have forgotten how to 

 do it. The duties of the toilet were the most sacred, and the elaborate dressing every day for dinner was a business that killed some time and improved Amy's taste in setting herself off. The Indian ladies had maids to assist in this important work, but theyhadnoobjection to criticise the Australian girls who helped each other. There was no needlework to he seen in a lady's hand, no, not the slightest description of fancy work even; cards and chess and a very light kind of reading, with conversation to match, filled np the time that was not spent over the numerous meals in a well-appointed steamer. It seemed an objectless existence after the busy active helpful life she had led at the Lindsays. She was too young to regret it much, but she missed something. On going to bed at night she could not think of anything she had done for any one, or any one had done for her except what had been done by the stewards and stewardesses, the people who were paid or who expected to he paid for it. The many kind offices that the members of an affectionate family can do for each other, or for people outside of their family, are unknown in such places as first class passenger ships and in the hotel-life in America; and it is one of the greatest drawbacks to their pleasantness and their usefulness. Even the children on TJo5Lrd, who were sent to Englandforhealthand education, were so assiduously waited on and indulged by the native servants in charge of them that there was little room for any services from their fellow passengers, and the poor little things had been so much spoiled and pampered by indulgent parents and numerous obsequious attendants that they were not nearly so charming as children of their age ought to be. 

 "Well," said Miss Porter one day to Captain Halcombe, with whom she had her most frequent skirmishes, combined W0h a little flirtation, " you may look down on Australia as you please, but we can live in it which you cannot do in India. Our heat 

 does not kill us, and Sydney people are not 

 obliged to send their children away from 

 them to save their lives." 

 "Are not they?" said Captain Halcombe, 

 with the intense ignorance on general j subjects common among second or third-rate ; military men, whose lives have been spent - in India, "I thought they were ; at least I j have heard it is a beastly climate�hot enough 

 for anything�that you had in Australia. j 

 " Miss Staunton comes from the hottest j settled part of Australia, and you see there , is no child sent from it, or from any of the 

 Australian ports," said Leonora. I 

 "Miss Staunton is English and not 

 colonial," said Captain Halcombe. j 

 " But you see there is nobody going home ill from our colonies," said Leonora, trium 

 phantly. I 

 "Oh! you. will send your sick people round the long voyage. The poor wretches 

 * The copyright and right of translation of "Hugh Lindsay's Guest" are reserved bjr the 

 cannot afford taking the P. and O. steamers, 

 so they get lots of sailing for their money." I 

 Indeed!1' said Leonora, who was just a 

 little purse-proud, for her father was reputed j wealthy and she was an only child. " You : may pique yourselves on your gentility as much as you please; hut as to fortune making, the day for that is over in India. It is to Australia that people come to make 

 money. I 

 " With shovels and pickaxes, that is how | all vou Australians make money; not our ^ way," said Captain Halcomhe. i 

 "How often have I told you that there is j comparatively little gold-digging in my colony j now-a-days, and in Miss Staunton's I don't i think there ever was any. And besides, � whoever heard of gold-diggers realizing for- I tunes. Mr. Harding comes from the gold- j fields colony, but I really don't tliink you j know the difference between one Australian ; province and another." I 

 " Indeed I do not. I don't like to burden j my memory with such unimportant details , as these. We know that there are several I Australian colonies, and that there are convicts and sheep and gold-diggings in them, but we leave you to settle the division of these tilings for yourselves." 

 " Don't you say that you have influence in Dowuing-street, and that you think you may receive a colonial appointment when you reach England ?" said Mr. Harding. 

 " Yes ; my uncle, Sir Wiliia 11, is in office, and I was always a prims favourite of his. 1 don't say that I object to Australia, provided the appointment is a good one." 

 " I see you are qualifying for a good thing in the colonies," said Mr. Harding, drily ; "but perhaps among other unimportant details you may have overlooked the fact that the colonies make their own appoint 

 ments." 

 " All of them ?" said Captain Halcomhe. " All except those of Governors." _ 

 " Oh ! I knew there was something to be ^iad." " 

 " Perhaps our little place might sy.it you : 

 said Mr. Harding. 

 " Is it a good thing ?" 

 " Pretty tidy, and we are very fond of military men," said Mr. Harding. 

 " There is nothing like a military man for such a post," said Captain Halcomhe, drawing up bis tall thin figure. " A man ought to have been accustomed to command in order to take the place of Her Majesty in 

 those colonies." 

 "Pardon me," said Mr. Harding, "the governments of all the Australian colonies are now constitutional, and the less the Governor commands the better." 

 "But there is an air, a prestige, about a military or naval officer which no civilian can possess. All points of precedence, all matters of etiquette, such men can settle by intuition, particularly if they have been in the Indian service. I flatter myself that not even in the British Court is there a more thorough understanding of such subjects 

 than we have in Calcutta." 

 "Your thorough understandings seem, however, to result in frequent misunder standings, Captain Halcomhe," said Mr. Harding. " All the unpleasant differences and quarrels we have had on board have been on these points of precedence, questions which personally I hold very cheap. We are all here on a footing of equality; age or convenience ought to settle who should have a place of especial honour or comfort. The P. and O. Company charge a handsome sum for each of us; in a business point of view the passengers who take the longest and most expensive voyage should have the preference, but I should set that aside and only require to have equal justice, which I think Australians scarcely obtain in these steamers. Why military men should take the precedence of civilians, and civilians over merchants and landowners ; why my friend Mr, Warren, from Tasmania, with his white head and his sixty-five honourable years, should be made to defer to any ignorant young captain in the Indian army, is a question which you may be able to answer, hut I cauuot. Judging the matter rationally and dispassionately " 

 " My good Sir," said Halcomhe, con descendingly, "tliat is where it is; you civilian mercantile colonists want to judge these things rationally and dispassionately. We never think of reasoning on them at alL We have a certain routine and certain rules for precedence, and we stick by them, for if we did not there would be no end of a row in every Government-House in India. And for your Australian little plaees I say there is an enormous advantage in having a man who is up to these tilings. He never blunders and nobody can take anything amiss 

 that be does." 

 "Indeed," said Harding; "I am delighted to hear of such satisfactory infallibility. It must be so very comfortable for all parties." 

 "Indeed it is," said the captain, not perceiving that the other was making fun of him; "and military men are liked, you say. I am glad to hear you fellows have such 

 goocl judgment." 

 "I'd be very glad to give you my good word in case a colonist's was of any avail to hack up your Downiug-street interest. I am very well known in my little place� have been in the House for some years." 

 "Indeed," said Captain Halcomhe 

 " what House 5" 

 " The Rouseof Assembly, our Parliament." " Oh ! yes, of course, yes ; I could see you were that sort of fellow�I suppose you can speak and all that sort of thing'!" 

 " A little in that way ; but in case any thing should turn up in Downing-street don't forget the address. Melbourne is the name of the chief town of our little place. 

 "'Oh yes; Melbourne in South Australia, 

 is it not?" 

 "Yeiynearit; a very good guess for an embryo governor," said Mr. Harding. "Mel bourne is the capital of the colony of Victoria, so called in honour of our most gracious sovereign. It was founded when Lord Mel bourne was Prime Minister, so we honoured lii'in by naming the future capital of Austral 

 " Oh no! Sydney will always be the capital," interrupted Miss Porter. 

 " But there arc a lot of Victorias surely," said Halcomhe, doubtfully. "I have heard of one that I don't think was hi Australia." 

 "Oh! you will know this from the others on account "of the gold that is in it, and by the chief town being Melbourne. I should advise you to write down the names together in your note-book, if you keep such a thing," said Mr. Harding, taking out his own, and gravely making a memorandum. "1 find this a valuable assistance to a memory that is singularly tenacious of some things, hut treacherous with regard to others." 

 "It is just the same with me," said Cap tain Halcomhe; "I really ought to keep a 

 note-book." 

 "Will you allow me to present you -with one? I have a very nice one at your service, like my own, bound in calf and gilt; but, unlike my own, it is not lettered." 

 "Oh! that makes no difference. I shall he much obliged to you for it, and I certainly will enter those little facts of yours as soon as I can�hut here is the pleasantest sound we hear in the day, the dinner hell. How useful this note-book of yours will he to con front the stewards with when they assert that they have varied our hill of fare. I shall keep a register of all our meals on board for the future. It is a glorious idea. I owe you oiig for the idea." 

 Leonora Porter saw the joke, and it had the effect on her which shrewd Mr. Harding had intended. Captain Halcomhe had been too attentive and Mr. Porter too unsuspicious. In all tbeir little squabbles, tlie young officer had generally wound up the discussion with a concluding compliment which Leonora had received graciously. He was tall, thin, and sallow, but had a good carriage and what is called a gentlemanly appearance, and he 

 Earaded his relations in England as well as 

 is importance in fashionable circles in Cal 

 cutta so as to impress the Sydney girl with a favourable idea of his birth and breeding. Sir. Harding had crossed the ocean several times, and he knew an exclusive preference for one person's society over that of others is 

 dangerous, although the result seems to be _ only quarrelling and squabbling. Sir. Porter's i heiress would be a very good catch for an j extravagant and self-indulgent captain in the Indian army, even though he had some influence in Downing-street. In these days 

 of comnetitive examinations and publicity j given to the abuse of patronage, a man of j Captain Halcombe's capacity or incapacity � could not be pushed forward much. | 

 This little scene, in which he had allowed j himself to be quizzed without discovery and j without resentment, showed Leonora the real | inferiority of his understanding, and his j ignorance not only of colonial matters, j which might be pardoned, but of other 

 matters more important to himself. How j often an adroit friend can serve a girl more by turning the conversation so as to make her admirer show her his character, than by 

 advice or warning. The discovery is then j her own, and though it may he unpalatable, it is swallowed, which a fneud's warnings and descriptions and analyses of the 

 character very rarely are. 

 There was another stoppage at Aden, and 

 , tlisii our friends sailed up tlie Red Se&; as it 

 j was during winter the passage was not ; ; insupportably bot. Amy felt it incongruous ; to go across the wonderful country of Egypt, ; so associated in the mind with ancient 

 history aud legend, by a modern railway, but j 

 | the Australians and Indians looked on it as a J 

 : matter of course, and scarcely made a remark 

 ! on the subject. As they drew nearer and j nearer to the shores of England, Amy grew | painfully anxious as to how lier brother j would receive her, and how she could possibly j come up to his apparently high expectations. 

 ; During the first part of tlie voyage, after she i ] hail learned to like Miss Porter and her 

 i father, she had rested in the present and j 

 tried not to fret about what was yet to come, 

 I but when she came in sight of England, 1 I which she had left four years before, her | heart beat thick and fast. Mr. Porter very ! kindly promised to stay with her at South | ampton till she could hear from her brother j or make arrangements for going to Stanmore, 

 although he himself wished to go to London | at once. The telegraphic despatch was sent and answered; Anthony would come at once to take his sister home, and she had nothing to do but sit and expect him. 

 "While Auny had been full of doubts and anxieties, Anthony had been constantly assuring himself that he had done right. His aunt's and sister's doubts had only the effect of convincing him that there was no sympathy to be got from them. Edith was 

 independent; Edith was, comparatively speak- ] ing, old, and had neither the love nor the | 

 deference for him which he knew ha should 

 receive from this sweet young sister who J would owe everything to him. He felt that i her letters were simple and grateful, and he was sure that personal acquaintance would only enhance her sense of all that he hail 

 done and would do for her. He was not ] imaginative, but still he rehearsed little scenes in which she would falter out hqr grateful thanks;�in which he would surprise her with costly gifts, which she could not imagine were for her; and in which her 

 cleverness and readiness would aid him in 

 keeping Edith in her proper place. 

 Even with an exchange of photographs as a preparation, at first sight a stranger looks like a stranger. Both brother and sister had idealized really good likenesses, till, on both sides, there was a shade of disappointment at the reality. Anthony looked darker and heavier aud more clumsy than his sister had fancied; and on this bleak day in the English spring, after a voyage in hot latitudes, Amy was not looking her best, aud her's was a style of beauty more winning than striking. He had expected nothing less than perfection from Mrs. George Copelaud's description and from his own prepossessions; and he could not help seeing that Amy was slightly freckled and sunburnt, all the effect of those 

 four years in so hot a country, and so much | 

 exposure to all weathers. 

 Still she was handsome, and, when she had I full justice in the matter of dress, would | eclipse Edith anywhere (of course the outfit 

 on which so much money and thought had I been spent in Adelaide, and which had been | 

 satisfactory in the steamers, was antediluvian and inadmissible in England). Amy was scarcely of middle height, while her brother and sister were talL Anthony was nearly as 

 tall as Allan Lindsay, but his figure was not I so symmetrical, and, though he had more acquired elegance of gait, he had not the easy strength of the young Scotchman. 

 How strange a meeting is between 

 brother and sister who have grown up | 

 sejiarately under widely different influences. A timidity unknown to Amy for many years 

 crept over her when she heard and answered | the numerous questions which her brother put to her; all on recent subjects�all only with regard to the time which had elapsed 

 sines he had communicated with her�her 

 voyage, her fellow passengers, her money matters. The se venteeu years which she had passed before evidently had no interest to I him�it was really to be a new life to her. 1 

 She felt enibarassed as to how Anthony ! expected her to speak to liim; was there to he j 

 the same limitation of their intercourse with ] regard to his past life ? But she had not been j long in his company before she knew that it j 

 was only, on her side that life was to be | regarded as having begun last October, and ' that there was no part of his previous history i that he did not expect to he interesting to Ms ] 

 sister. i 

 As Anthony had enquired about fellow j 

 passengers, she asked leave to introduce the ' 

 Porters to him, as they had shown her | great kindness on the voyage. 

 " Who are they?" asked Anthony, with a | little suspicion in his tone. 

 " Sir. Porter is a Sydney merchant, and a very pleasant kind old gentleman, and Leo nora and I have been great friends all the voyage." 

 " You seem to have a knack of picking up ; great friends, Amy�of course I must be introduced to these people, but I don't want you to keep up any intimacy with Australians. Of coarse during a voyage, there is no help for it; you are forced to have these people's 

 company whether you will or not; hut it is i au understood thing that unless a young lady's guardians approve of the acquaintance, it is dropped on landing." 

 " But they have been so kind, and 

 Leonora " 

 "Oh ! yes, T understand all that. I suppose you would be grateful to any one who passed a plate or said good morning to you good naturedly. But Edith is strongly prejudiced against Australia, and I tkihk that it will he necessary to drop these people. I don't think any the worse of my little sister for these marks of an affectionate disposition, indeed I think it very charming; hut yon owe somet.img to Edith's prejudices and my 

 wishes." 

 " I thought�I mean, I wished, that mr sister could have accompanied you, but 1 suppose I was unreasonable," said Amy. 

 " You see, Edith is of rather a peculiar ' temper, and is not so favourably disposed ' 

 towards you as I am. She is somewhat '4 uneasy at your having mixed so long with i those vulgar people who have also been kind ' to you in their way, and she is afraid you j may have imbibed their manners, so that 

 new Australian friendships and acquaintances ! 

 would prejudice her still more. I do not at ' all despair of you�although you have picked up the Scotch accent more strongly than I could have expected you to do in four years, and may have a few other gauclieries. You will soon shake off these tMugs when you are habitually in really good society. As for your defective education, we must see what 

 we can do to remedy it, although those 

 precious years have been wasted. T wish I something could he done with your dress ! before you left Southampton, hut 1 suppose 

 you must go as you are. Edith aud my aunt j are rather critical in these matters, and may 

 pronounce you as antediluvian as our | rector's lady did hlrs. George Oopeland on her lirst appearance at church." 

 "Is Miss Derrick at Stanmore?" said! 

 Amy, who felt that the ordeal was going to 

 be severe. 

 " Oh! yes, she always stayed with us in my grandfather s time, and, though she some times talks of taking up her abode in a separate establishment with her favourite 

 Edith, I fancy that there are advantages in j living at Scamnore as the head of my 

 establishment that she does not care to forego." 

 "I suppose it is a beautiful place; indeed I I know it is." I 

 "There is none finer in the country," said Anthony, with enthusiasm, for this was the most felicitous remark thai Amy hadioade. "And of course in a pecuniary 

 point of view it is a good arrangement for ] them to live in my house aud have the use of my carnages, horses, and servants. But, 

 as is natural and proper, I still like to he i 

 master in my own house, and invite whom < I please to it; and I have been hurt at the ; manner in which both my aunt aud Eilith have behaved with regard to you. My aunt is naturally partial to her side of the house, and thinks that our poor mother behaved very badly with regard to the second marriage. Iu fact it is only of late years that I have been told of my mother's existence, for my childish idea was that she was dead when she left us. It is a sore subject with the Derricks. I have over looked it, because it is of course no fault of 

 yours, bat you will see the wisdom of not ! speaking to Miss Derrick or to Edith of your father, or your mother either, unless in answer to any question they may put to 

 you. I am sorry to say that it will be ] necessary for you to he careful if you wish to 

 he comfortable with theui." 

 "I will try," said Amy, who could not j help looking back regretfully to the home where she never needed to he on her guard. 

 " You are a little afraid, Amy," said Anthony, "hut I will stand up for you. 

 I do not want you to give up any of your ] rights in their favour; aud after all if you satisfy me, which I am sure you will try to do, that is the important point." 

 "Do you ever see Darlington Castle?" asked Amy. 

 "No, 1 have not been there yet. The earl has been very cool to us, and, although I have met him at Lady Gower's, I cannot 

 say that I get on with Mm." j 

 " Does our grandaunt, Lady Grower, know of your invitation t j me ?" asked Amy. 

 " Yes; and, like all our friends, disap proves of it, in spite of tlie Darlington countenance wliieli. she acknowledges that you have. I want you to come out with success to justify iny precipitation. I felt there was no time to be lost, and that it 

 should be done at once." 

 Anthony submitted to be introduced to the Porters, and thanked the old gentle man formally for his kind protection of his little sister, and then hurried Amy away to take the first train. Her eyes were full of tears as she bade good-by to Leonora, who promised to write to her from London, and hoped to hear all about that beautiful country house of Stanmore. Authony thought the Porters were desirous of getting into good county society by means of Amy and took a dislike to them. He had no wish to be forestalled in her affections by any girlish friendship. Amy had no family connections in the world but himself who cared about her; her Australian friendships were all put aside and done with, and he looked on her heart as a blank piece of sensitive paper, ready to be impressed witb bis image and his image alone. 

 During the long railway journey Anthony had little to say, and Amy shrunk into the comer of the carriage and weighed all the difficulties of her position. The only comfort she could find was in the thought that Allan would not be sorry to bear that her path was not all of roses ; and the only pleasure she could look forward to witb any confidence was a visit to Jessie to see her and her baby.
