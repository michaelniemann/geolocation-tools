 CHAPTER IV. 

 Extracted from t7tc Diary of the Rev. James North. 

 AuODST 21 -Theie has been but one entry in mi journ ii since the 30th June, und that but to record the advent of our new Commandant, wlio as I expected, waa Captain Mnuiico Freie 

 So gi eat havo been the changes which base Ukeu place, that I scarcely know how to rccoid them Captniu Trero has realised my worst anticipations He 13 brutal, vindictive, and domineering His knowledge of prisons and prisoners gises lum nu advantage over Buifcess, otherwise ho much resembles tint mindel out animal Ho has but one thought-to keep the pnsoucrs in suljcction So long as the island is quiet, ho cares not whether the men In0 or die "I �as Bent down here to keep order, ' said he to mc a few dijs after his arm ni, "and by God, sir, 111 do it ' 

 Ho has done it, I luust admit, but at n cost of a legacy of li itred to himself that ho inaj some d ly regret to havo earned Ho has organ ised three parties of police One pitiols the fields, one ison guard at stores uni public build nigs, and the thn d is employ ed as a detective force There are two liundied soldiers on tho island, and tho omcei in chaine, Cnptun M Nab, has been induced by licie to mci ease their duties m uiauyssajs The cords of discipline aie suddenly di awn t%ht Foi the disouler which prevailed when 1 landed, Ti ere has sub stituted a budden and excessive rigor Any officer found gis mg the smallest piece of tobacco to a prisoner is liable to 1 euios al f 1 om the island The tobacco which giows wilu has been rooted up and destroj eel lest the men Bhould obtain n leaf of it Hie pus llego of having a pannikin of hot water svhen the giugs carne m from field labor in the es cning has been ss ithdraw n Tho shepherds, hut keepers, and all othei prison�s, whether at the Btations of Longridge or the Cas- cades (where the 1 uc,li�h consicts aie stationed), are forbidden to keep a pal rot or any othei hu c1 '1 he plaiting of sti ins hats din lug thu piisoners' leisure hours is also prohibited At the settle mentsshere the "old hands'aie located titled boundaries have boen erected, beyond which no prisoner dare pas� unless to vsoik Two days igo, lob Dodd, a ne0ro, lot his j icket fall os ei the boundary nils, cros'-ed them toi ecos er it, and was severely flogged The flogcangB aio hideously frequent On dogging moi ninga I base seen tho giound svheie the men stood �it the triangles saturated ssith blood, as if a bucket of blood had been spilled on it, eos enng a Bpace three feet ni diameter, and running out 111 sanous directions, in little streams tisooi tlneo feet long At the same time, let me s ij, with that strict justice I f iree mjhclf to mete out to those whom I dislike, tint the lshud is ma condition of abject tublnisBion Thero l8 not much chance of mutiny The men go to their work without a murmur, and sliuk to their dormitoiles like whipped hounds to kennel Iho gaols and solitary (I) cells are ciosvdcd ssith prisoners, and each day sees f 1 tsh sentences for fresh crimes It is cunio here to do nnj thing 

 but live 

 The method by sshtch Captain Trero has brought about this repuse of desol ition is chaiac tenstie of him He Bets on every man to be a spy upon his neighbor, ass es the moro darmg into obedienco by the displaj of a rufliainsin more outrageous than then own, and raising tho worst scoundrels 111 tho place to office, compels thom to find " cases for punishment Pel fidy is rewarded It has been made part t f a cons let policemans duty to search a fcllosv insouei anywhere and at any time This searching is often conducted in a w antonlj roucji mid dis 

 gustmg manner , and if resistance is offeied, the mau resisting can be knocked doss n by a blow from tho searcher s bludgeon Inquisitorial vigilance and lndisctimmatiug harshuets pievail everywhere, and the hsc3 of hundteds of prisoners aro reduced to a continual agony of terror and self loathing 

 " It is impossible, Captain rrero," said I, one daj, during the initiation of this sjstent, "to think that these villains whom you base lnado constables vsill do their duty " 

 Ho replied, '"Ihoy must do their duty If they aro indulgent to the prisoners, thoy know I shall Hog 'em If thej do what I tell em, they'll make themselves so h itcd that thos d lins e their ow n father up to tho triingles to sav e themscls es being sont back to the ranks " 

 " You treat them then like slave keepers of a wild beast den T hej must flog the animals to avoid being flogged themselves " 

 " Ay, said he, ss lth his coarse laugh, " and having once llo^ged em, thoj d do nnj thing rather than be put 111 the cage, don t 3 0 Bec 1 

 It is horrible to think of this sort of logic being used by a man who bus a wife,and friends �nd enemies It is tho logic that the Keeper of tho Tormented would use, I should think I am sick unto death of the pi ice It makes me a 

 diBbchoser in the social charities It takes out 

 of penal scienco anything it may possess of nobility or worth It is ci uel, debasiug, mini 

 man 

 August 20 -Saw Ruf us Dasv es again to day His usu ii be lrmg is ostentatiously rough and brutal lie seems to has o sunk to that pitch of self abasement 111 which one takes a delight in one s degr idntion 1 his condition is one familiar 

 to me 

 He is working m the chain gang to which H inkey was mude sub overseer Blind Mooney, an ophthalmic prisoner, ss ho ss as remos ed f ruin tho gang to hospital, told mo that th-re svas a plot to murder Hankey, but that Dawes, to whom he hld shosvu somo kindness, had pre vented it I BVSV Hankey and told lum of this, asking him if ho had been ass are of the plot He said 'No,' falling into a great tremble "Major Pratt promised moa remos al, said he "1 expected it svould come to this ' I asked him why Dawes defended bim , and, after some troublo, he told me exacting fi oin me a promise that I would not acquaint the Command mt It seems that one morning last sscek Hankey had gone up to Captain brere 3 house ssith n return from 1 roke, and coming back through the garden had plucked a flosver Dais c3 had asked bun for this flosver, offering tsvo dus s lation for it Hankey, who is not a bad heaitcd man, gase him the sprig " Thero ss ere teirs m his eyes as ho took it, saul he 

 There must bo some vs ay to get at this man s 

 heart b id as ho seems to be 

 August 28 -Hankey was murdered .yesterday He applied to bo removed from tho gaol gang, but Frere refused " I never let my men 'funk, 

 he said " If they se threatened to minder jon, 111 keep j ou thero another month 111 spite of 

 ein 

 Someone who oserhcaidtbis,ieported it to the gang, ind they set upon the unfortunate gaoler yesterday and beat his brains out with their shovels Tioke Bays that the wretch who was foremost cned, " 1 here's for you , and if your master don t take caro, he 11 get sers ed the umo one of these days I' The gang ss ere employed at building n reef m the sea, and si ero working up to their armpits in vsater Hankey fell into the surf, and neser moved after the firot blow I saw the gang, and Dawes said, 

 "It was Frero's fault, ho should have let the 

 man go 1 

 "I am surprised you did not interfere, ' said I " I did all I could," was the man's anssver " AVhat'B a life more or less 7ici c I ' 

 This occurrence has spread consternation among the overseers, and they have addressed a " round robin" to the Commandant, praying to be relieved from their positions 

 The way Frere has dealt with this petition is characteristic of him, and fills mo at onco with admiration and disgust He came down with it m his hand to the gaol gang, svnlked into tho yard, shut the gate, and said, "I've just got Mus from my oserseers They say they re afraid you'll murder them as you murdered Hankey 

 Now, if you want to murder, murder mc Here 1 am Step out, one of you ' All this, said in a tone of the most galling contempt, did not move them I saw a dozen pairs of eyes flash hatred, but the bull-dog courage of the man oserawed them here, as, I am told, it had done m Sydney It would havo bien easy to kill him then and there, and his death, I am told, is sworn among them , but no one raised a finger The only man who moved was Rufus Daw es, and ho checked himself instantly Treic, with a recklessness of w Inch I did not think him capablej stepped up to this terror of the prison, and ran his hands lightly down his sides, as is the custom with constables svhen "searching" a man ^.'.Jtt "Wrfftt of " Hi� Natural I i/o has been par

 CHAPTER V 

 MR TUCH VTID DEVINE SURFRISID 

 Tho town house of Mr Richard Devine was in Clnrges street Not that tho v ery modest mnu sion theio situated was the only establishment which owned Richard Dev me as master Mr John Rex had exponsna tastes Ho ueithei " Bhot ' nor " hunted so ho had no capital 111 \\ ested in Scotch moors or Leicestershire hunting boxes But his stables n ei e tho � oudei of Lon- don, ho owned almost a lacmg village near Don castei, kopt n yacht at Cones, and 111 addition to a hou�e in Puns, paid the rent of a villa at Biompton He vvis member of several clubs of the faster sort, and might have lived like a prince at any one of them had he boen so minded, but that a certain constant nnd haunting feai of detection-a fenr which three y cara of unquestioned ease and un bridled not lind not dispelled-led him to prefei the privacy of his own hou^o, wheio he could choose his own society Tho house m C1 irgcs street was decoiated m conformity with tho tastes of its owner The pictures weic pie 

 tures of horses, the books were lecoids of rices, or novels purporting to describe sporting life Mr Francis Wide, waiting on the mornuigof the 20th Amil, 1840, for tho advent of Ins nephew, sifehed as ho thought of the cultured quiet of 

 Northond House 

 Mi Richard appeared in that dressing gowned condition in which men of fashion at that pel 11 d w ero accustomed to " go of a morning 1 bree yeais of good living and hard dunking hld dcpni ed his figure of its athletic beauty Ho w is past forty years of age-npeuod of life when most men become conscious of a paunch The sudden cessation fiom tho seveie bodily toil to which his active life as convict and squatter had accustomed him, caused Mr Richai d s 11 itu ial piouoness to the Iiouois of a belly toinciease, and mstcid of being poi tly he had boeome gro� His cheeks were inflamed with ficqucnt ippli cation of hot aud rebellious liquors to his blood His hinds were swollen, and not as steady its of yore His vvhiskcis �oro sticaked with unhealthy grey His eyes, bright and black as el ci, lui kui in a thicket of crow s feet He had become pre maturely bald-a sure sign of nient il 01 bodily excess He spoke with affected heartiness, md in that boisterous tono which betiays its own assumption of ease 

 " Ha, ha I My de ir uncle, sit down Delighted to Beo you Have you breakfasted '-of course j ou hav e / was up rather late last night Quito sin o you won't have anything A glass of wine ? No-then Bit don 11 and tell me all the now s of Hampstead " 

 "lliunk you, Riclmid, said the old gentle man, a little stiflly, ' but I want some sciious tilk with you YA lint do j ou intend to do with tho proporty ? This indecision won les mo 1 ithci 1 eheve mo of my ti net or bo guided by my advice ' 

 "Well, the fact is," said Mr Richaul, with a very ugly look on Ina fico " Phe fact is, mid y ou may as vv eil know it at once-I nin much pushed for money ' 

 " Pushed for money ' ' cried Mr Wade, in hoiroi "Why, Puikm said tho piopeitywns woi th tw enty thousand 11 y ca� ' 

 " So it might have been-five yeais ago-but 

 my homo racing, mid betting, and otliei amuse 1 mciits, concerning which you need not too euri ously enquire, have 1 educed its value consider ably ' 

 Ho spoke recklessly and louglily It was evi- dent that success had but developed Ins mill 111 ism His "dandyism ' was but eompu itive The impulse of poieity and scheming which led lum to ufiect the "gentleman having been lcmovcd, the uatuial brutality of his nature showed itself 111 all its native defonnity Mr Frunc�a Wade took a pinch of snuff with a sharp 

 motion of diBtasto " I do not want to heal o� your dcbniicheiics," he said, " our name has been sufficiently disgraced m my hearing ' 

 "What is got over the devils Kick goes under his belly," replied Mr Richnid, coaisely " My old f ithcr got Ins money by dirtier vi ny s than these m which I spend it As villainous nu old Bcoundrel and bkuifhut as ever poisoned asea man, 111 g J bul 

 Mr 11 incis rose " Yon need not revilo youl f ithcr, Riehnrd-ho left y ou all ' 

 " Ay, but by pure accident Ho duln t mean 

 If he hadn t died in tho nick of tune that unhung murderous villain, Mnurico 1 rere, would havo come in for it By the way, ho added, with a change of tone, "do you ever hear any- thing of Maurice ' 

 "I have not heard for some yeais, ' sud Mr YA ade " He is something 111 the Convict De part mont nt Sydney, I think ' 

 " Is he 1 said Mr Richard, with somotlnng like a shiver Hope he '1 stop there Well, but about business U he fact id, that-that I am thinking of selling everything 

 ' helling everything ' ' 

 " Yea Pon my soul I am The Hampstead plnco aud all 

 "Sell Noithend House '' cried Mr Wado, in bewilderment " Why, the carving by Grinling Gibbons are the finest in England 

 " I can t help tint, ' laughed Mi Richard, ringing the boll "I want cash, and cash I must have -Breakfast, Smithers -1 m going to 

 tiavel ' 

 Tiancis Wado was breathless with astonish- ment Educated and leaiod as he had been, ho w ould as soon havo thought of proposing to sell St Paul s Cathedral, as to Bell the casket which held his treasures of art-his coins, his coffee cups, his pictures, and his "proofs before letters ' 

 "Surely, Richaid, you are not in earnest,' he gasped 

 " I am, indeed " 

 " But-but who vv ill buy it ! 

 " Plenty of people I Bhall out it up into building allotments Besides, tboy are talking of a suburban line, with a terminus at St Johu's Wood, which will cut the garden in half You are quite sure you have breakfasted? Then pal don me 

 "Riclimd, you are jesting with me I Yon will nev er let them do such a thing 1 ' 

 " I'm thinking of a trip to America," says Mr Richard, cracking an egg " I am sick of Europe After all, what is the good of a man like me pro tending to belong to ' au old family,' with ' a seat' and all that humbug ? Money is the thing now, my dear unclr> Hard cash ! That's tho ticket for soup, you may depend ' 

 "Then what do you purpose doing, sir ? ' 

 " To buy my inotliei s life mtereot as pro vided, realise upon the property, and travel," said Mr Richard, helping himself to potted 

 grouse 

 "You amaze me, Richard Yon confound mo Of course, y ou can do as you please But so sudden a determination The old house-scat 

 tered-v ases-coins-pictures-I really-Well, it is your property,of course,-and-and-I wish you a very good morning I 

 " I mean to do as I please," soliloquised Rex, as he resumed his bieakfaat " Let him sell his rubbioh by auction and go and live abroad, in ! Germany or Jerusalem it he likes, the farther 

 the better for me I'll sell off the property and make myself scaice A trip to America will benefit my health " 

 A knock at the door made him start 

 " Come m I Curse it, how nervous I'm get ting What's that ? Letters ? Giv e them to me , and why the devil don't you put the brandy on the table, Smithers ? ' 

 He drank some of tho gym it groedilj, and I began to open his cnrcqiondcnce 

 ' Cussed brute, Mid Mr bmithen, outside the dooi " He could nt uso ssuss lmgssidCjU if he ssas a dook, dam un '-Aciii, he added, suddenly, as a roai from his m�stet lecvlled lum

 Left to hnu->tlt again, Mr Richard walked huinedlj up and down the chamber, wiped his forehead, drank a tuuiblei of br mdy, and finally sat dow II and re read tho lettei It w as short, but terribly to tho purpose
