NED KELLY, THE BUSHRANGER IN ARMOUR. CHAPTER V. MAN AGAINST TRAIN � WHICH WILL GIVE WAY ? The train was almost due. I had not a moment to lose if I would succeed. I dashed out of the signal house with far less caution than I had entered it, and the next instant had slid down a most precipitous cutting on the line. As I reached the metals the sonnd of the picks ceased. I looked up the line and saw the bushrangers putting on their jackets.

I could see the bulbous engine-funnel. It ...~two miles away, but coming at a pace of fifty miles an hour. Acouple and a half minutes now and it would be saved or wrecked, be still occupied by living breathing people or be filled with corpses. On it came, "rattle, rattle, rattle! thunder, thunder, thunder!" Already I could feel the iron rail vibrate beneath my feet as it approached. I slipped on one side, made myself as conspicuous as I could in the very clearest patch of moonlight and waved my red danger flag frantically to and fro. On came the train. The engine driver or the stoker should have seen me by now, but it did not seem as though either did, for there wasn't the slightest slackening of speed. More furiously than ever I waved my flags. I screamed-I yelled! All to no purpose. The train was on me. I screwed myself back into the bank to save myself from being swept away by the wind that it created and perhaps dashed under the wheels by the eddy. The engine shot past me, and I saw that the driver and stoker were squatted on a coal-bunker, playing cards. That was how they had not seen me. I happily still continued to yell and wave my flag about, however. All at once the guard's head was thrust out of a window. I was heard and seen. "Rails up in front!" I screamed. And then as his head disappeared again, I heard something jerk, and a bell in the front part of the train feebly tinkle out. To my great joy, I saw the carriages the next instant slacken speed and several heads thrust forth from the windows. Presently there was a full stop. I ran after it, though I saw the guard had alighted, and was coming to meet me. "Halloa! what's the meaning of all this?" he exclaimed gruffly, as he came up. "It means that I've saved all your lives," I answered rather nettled. "Ned Kelly and his gang have set a death-trap for you just beyond, in order to seize the gold, They've laid the rails so as to carry the train over into the gully, a hundred feet below!" "Good Heavens!" was all that the guard could ejaculate for a second or two, but by that time the blue jackets and white shakos of a posse of the Victorian police were around me, and I precious soon informed them of Ned Kelly's little game. "Take the train back to Beechworth," said the superintendent who was in command of the gold escort, to the guard. "Eighty-nine thousand pounds' worth of gold dust and nuggets must not be risked lightly. We will telegraph to you to come on directly the rails are relaid and the line clear." Then turning to me he said � "Hogan, though I'm your superior in rank, I think you've every right to command the present expedition. We must take Kelly and his gang alive or dead. There will be no security for either life or property from one end of Victoria to the other until the turf covers and weeds grow atop of those rascals." (TO BE CONTINUED.) have tried it. Hundreds are
