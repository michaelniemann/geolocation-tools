CHAPIEBIY. 

 'I�f*I were in the Imnt ot Cotten, Old time! tfctre are not forretten, Loot an;, look awiy, look aw�r , .down to Dixie's My name is not Bowser. That is a niak [uunv my mates gave me on a mine at Gympie, 9��u*e of * habit I bad when any great I 

 weight was to be raised by lever or poUey, of singing ont 'Bowse her up, boys.' I nave carried it about with me, and osed it to con ceal my identity, -My real name is Egbert Howell, and my family owned, and I trust stm own, large estates, in West Virginia. Towards the close of the fifties our home was happy with the presence of fattier, mother, my Drother Wngh, and sisters *''^*^i Susan, and Lauretta, l was just home from West Point, full of fun and frolic, sad ready for all ir^P^ of mnwnrrTrt Mid *�'*�*'?'''�'*?? Among our friends, and not distant neighbours, wen a family of the name of Sheridan. Their estate was in the adjoining state of Maryland. GeoigB Sheridan and I had men school-fellows. He waa a year older than 'L, clever, versatile, good humoured, kind hearted,� each a friend at a man ahould prize. Much u I loved him, I loved hii sister Elmina more. He returned the sVMnpl i nsqn^ by Ainnji hu heart to my sister Lauretta. When I think on the happi ness of those youthful days, and gaze acroat the dreary past, no wonder I try to drown my sorrow. My attempts but whet the teeth ol remerse, which have sunk deep into my heart. At the period of which I speak, the conten tion between the northern and southern States of America, an the questions which led to the civil war, had began to agitate men'! minds. The Sheridans declared at once fa the abolition of slavery: my father's sympa. thus were all with the pro-slavery party. Be attended the meetings held, took an active part in politics, and guided public opinion it the distant. I was not so eager, because 3 cared not to cast ont with my friends. But as the content grew keen, feelings became ex cited, and the lines of division in soda] circles and even in families stood out clearly. At last the crisis came, and, urged by my father, I joined the mastering ranks of the southern army. My military training led to my being faimndiatrly entrusted with the com. maud of the Fifty-fifth Virginia. Association with men whose antagonism to the northern federation was bitter and uncompromising aroused my passions, and with tin heedless ardour of yooth, I plunged into the contest The populace was also eager, and full of sympathy. Well do I remember when march ing through Leesbarg, the day before Jack son's corps waded the Potomac at White'a Ford, an old lady standing by the wayside, with uplifted hands, and tears etreaminj; from her eyes, exclaiming ' The Lord bless your dirty, ragged souls.' I will not weary yon with the man-hing, fighting, retreating, and straggling in toe early years of the conflict. I come to the fighting, which took place in Maryland in 1882. The second defeat at Bull Bun, or Menassss Junction as it was diversely called by the contending forces, bad enabled Lee to transfer the theatre of operations from tile front of Bichmond to the front of Washington. Maryland was a divided state : the people were not to be trusted ; but when our regiment camped a mile from Amberga, where the Sheridans resided, I could not re sist the temptation of visiting the family. Had I not been known personally to one of the hone-keepers, I should have fared badly. Ele, s.t my jnsrujition, took me prisoner and led me before Mrs. Sheridan for disposal. So far the meeting was not pleasant. It was prevented becoming distinctly so by Elmins's tact and temper. With her my interview was sweet but sad ; aud when I felt the tears on her face as I kissed her, I could have stripped myself of my ragged grey uniform, and fled far from the conflict Bat the bogle call sounded in the distance, and I returned so far under escort to my comrades. On the 14th of September, 1862, in the year after my majority, was fought the battle of Cramptou'd Gap. General Howell Cobb had been directed to hold it to the last man ; against it mustered the forces of General Franklin, which included Newton's 

 Brigade in which George Sheridan was a cap tain. We were posted on the neigh's; the enemy attacked us from below. From noon the battle raged on that steep hillside. Our artillery on the heights -covered as on the elope. Every stone and hollow that could afford shelter was taken advantage of on either side, but the advance of the Ohio regi ments opposed to us could not be checked. )utnumuering as considerably they slowly forced their way, till we were driven up on to the ridge. Evening was falling when the final struggle took place. I was rallying my men, who were showing haste in retiring when a federal officer in advance of his men waring them on, made a dash at me. To parry hu blow, and thrust my sword through him was the work of an instant. As he fell the slant ing sanlieht caught his countenance ; it was George Sheridan. There waa a yell from the advancing troops, and a cheer from my com rades as they fired, and hurried me with them in their le treat The thought of that en counter was a torment and an agony for dayB and weeks. The fact that I had killed the brother of my sweetheart, and the lover of my sister, burned in my brain like a tongue of name from thenethermost pit. I ('straggled' away from the army, aud by various devices reached Canada. Thence I went to England, but could not settle. Australia seemed to in ?-*� ��. Hither I came� and in the restless, independent, exciting work of mining I have managed to pass the last twenty years of my We. Yes, I wrote to my mother some few years ago � not long before you and I became mates� when, the horrors from one of my drinking bouts. I have only a hasy idea of what I said, but I fancy I told her I had killed George Sheridan, and having done so and deserted from the army I couTd not face my friends again. When Blair and Howell, as we may now engnate him returned from their trip to Amooeea estate they found the Gbnina mine had been floated for �240,000, and that the shares were already selling at 25s.
