 Chatter XXII. 

 asthoxv's remonstrance. 

 Amy mounted her horse with George's assistance, and rode in silence with her brother for about a quarter of a mile. She wanted to speak and did not know what to say ; any idea that occurred to her appeared open to objection. She knew that Anthony was displeased, and yet she did not feel that she had done wrong. A remark about the house, or the farm, or the family, or Jessie, or the baby would only aggravate this offence, and for a while she felt unable to speak of anything else, for her heart was full of these subjects. A comparison of the scenery with that of Australia was also discarded as dangerous. Gould she say anything about Madeira and her visit there - Would Anthony not like, when they were by themselves, to hear her speak of their mother, and her illness and death? She was not sufficiently experienced in the art of conversation to be able to lead dexterously to the subject, and the more anxious she felt to break the painful silence the more her ideas refused to shape themselves. At last Anthony happened to cough; it was a little nervous cough preliminary to speaking to his sister, but she took advantage of it to ask if lie had had this cough long. ^ 

 "Oh, no ! indeed, I don't know ii I have 

 a cold at Till." 

 "I don't like to hear people cough, 

 especially those whom I love," said Amy, 

 with a little sigh. 

 " Oh! my cough is nothing ; you need not fidget yourself about it." 

 "Both you and your Bister seem to he very strong." 

 4' Stronger than you appear to he certainly. You do not seem among other good things to have picked up the size of those people whom you try so much to imitate." 

 44 No, I am slight, like mamma," said Amy 44 Papa said I was very like what mamma was before she was ilL Did you know that we went with her to Madeira?" 

 44No, indeed! when was that?" asked 

 Anthony. 

 4 4 When I was eleven years old. It was such a beautiful voyage, mamma liked it so 

 much." 

 44 Did she?" asked Anthony ; 44 and it did her good I suppose." 

 4; Only for a time, and then she wearied to go home again, and we had a long disagree able passage and had weather and contrary winds, and poor mamma was very ill indeed 

 ^vlien we landed." 

 441 suppose our mamma used to speak to you about me sometimes." 

 44 Only twice or thrice in her life." 44 Indeed!" said Anthony. 

 44Do you recollect her, Anthony?" asked 

 Amv, with tearful eyes. 

 "A very little, and the miniature keeps up the recollection�she was very like you. But it is very strange that she should not have spoken to you about me. I was her 

 eldest child and her only son." 

 "Not her only son, Anthony. I had three brothers who died young ; hut you ?know """Tina- might think a great deal about you without saying much, and it could do no good speaking to me on the 

 subject when I was so young. "What she 

 had to say she said to papa, I suppose." 

 "She must have felt that she had done 

 very wrong to leave her children in the way she did. 1 have no doubt that it preyed on i her mind and led her to an early death." J 

 44 No; it was a neglected cold that brought ; on her illness first," said Amy, simply. "I hope it was not what you say, because it would have been very miserable for her to have such feelings. She knew that you had kind relations, and were well provided and . cared for. I hope she was not all her life j 

 unhappy about that." 

 44 And you were always poor, Amy. Your father was an ill-paid over-worked literary hack, with indifferent health. You ought to feel that things are veiy different with you 

 now. . 

 44 Very different, indeed," said Amy, with | a sigh. " The had health was very sad; hut mamma was very patient and papa too." 

 44 Dow did our mother speak of me on those two or three occasions when she mentioned my name to you ?" said Anthony. *- 44 Only that I was to he friendly with you 

 if you or my sister ever tried to be friendly with me, and I am sure I will obey her in that -, hut when papa got no answer to his letters announcing mamma's death, we * thought you did not care anything about her 

 or me either." 

 44 And that was the reason you did not write to me on your fathers death. Did you 

 never think of it?" 

 44 Yes, I thought of it, hut I felt so timid 

 I could not do it." ! 

 44 It is very unfortunate, for at that age we mi^ht have moulded you into what we plenseS. I do not say that I despair of making you in time a credit to me; but I canuotTsay inucb for your acceptance of your new position to-day. You have observed that I have not been pleased." 

 44 Yes," said Amy; 441 am sorry you are not pleased." 

 44 You should he sorry that you have given me so inncli cause. It is a good thing that Edith did not accompany us." 

 44 But, Anthony, I could not keep at a distance from those with whom I lived for years. I could not hurt Jessie's feelings by assuming great airs with her. I don't ask joe to he familiar with them." 

 441 should think not; hut remember that when you go out with me you take my level," said Anthony, as if this must and. should 

 settle the matter. 

 The tears stole silently down Amy's cheeks. D Anthony was so obtuse and so unsympatnizing no expostulation or explana tion would do any good. She could not help now looking forward to a return to Australia, and thinking of straightforward Allan Lindsay's devoted love more kindly and more seriously than ever. 

 And yet she was still eager and anxious to please her new-found relatives; she felt that she had much to learn, though she did "* not think there was so very much to unlearn 

 as Anthony supposed. If she could ouly be allowed to go to school to gather a few subjects for conversation which would not be obnoxious to her brother and sister! The school to which Leonora Porter was going, a fashionable establishment at Brighton, was of course the most desirable to Amy, and the least so to her brother, so that was �iven up ; but she would have preferred to "O to any school rather than to have her lessons at home, especially as her sister and Miss Derrick evidentlywished her to he out of the house, and the education that her brother paid for and the companions she was 

 introduced to by bis means would always lie j subjects on which her lips might be v.r.- J 

 sealed. 

 Amy found, however, that Anthony was determined that he should have his 

 osa way; be rather liked tbc constant ' antagonism with regard to lus little sister, 1 and the position of her advocate and defender ' in all things, small and great, that the others , took exception to. He took pleasure in j himself engaging her masters and hearing 

 their praises of her abilities and docility. ] He watched over her progress with interest, j and felt how much she owed to him, for he I spared neither trouble nor expense to procure i her the best and most fashionable instruc 

 tion. There was one disappointment�her 1 voice was not equal to her taste, and no | cultivation could make her a singer; but > other things were satisfactory. So as he had i creatly undervalued lier acquirements when she arrived, at the end of a year, in which she worked faithfully and successfully, he wa3 disposed to over-estimate her acquire ments, which certainly were sufficient to throw'Edith's completely into the shade. 

 Although these private lessons were not j all"that Amy had wished they were a great ; relief to her. They were something to do j and something to speak of, and something too to write to Allan about witnout dilating on her domestic position. She learned to

 cruel and injudicious censures wn-.cn had pained her so much at first. She liau only to complain of his lavish and mjuuicious praises of her before her sister ana. -liss Derrick, and of the invidious conmaiison3 which he was too apt to draw. Anthony cer tainly grew proud and fond of her�a fondness capricious and seusitivcly jealous; but stnl liis attentions, his liberality, and bis praises gratified the girl whore strongest feelings 

 were her desire to please and her wish to be 

 loved. 

 It was an ungraceful present, that of a new watch and chain, in order that Hugh Lindsay's parting gift should be tabooed.; but she hung the locket to the chain and

 : felt that she still wore wliat kept lier in mind of the kindly and generous old man. j It was not often she could manage to go 

 to Millmount, but when she did she went alone, and so her brother could not hear what passed between her and her Australian friends. Every month a long letter ad 

 dressed in a bold masculine hand from ! Allan Lindsay provoked the frowns and ill humour of Anthony, and every month she 

 sat up half a night to write an answer. : This was the one point on which she made a 

 ' stand. Anthony, however, -consoled him- [ 

 self with the thought that she was only a school-girl, and trusted that when she had been brought out, and knew what society t was, and received the attention and admira 

 tion which her beauty and grace and accom- j plishments deserved, she would gradually j drop this ridiculous and objectionable ' correspondence with her old pupil, though i 

 Edith sometimes sneered at the expense and : trouble he was at to educate and polish a 

 wife for some Vandal of a Lindsay in the - bush. I
