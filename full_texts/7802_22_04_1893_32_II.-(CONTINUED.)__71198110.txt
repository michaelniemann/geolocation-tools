 -CHAPTER IL-(CONTINUED.) 

 " Ob, Mr. Devereux 1" exclaimed a voice just behind them. "You know BO muoh about shells, do tell me what this one can bo. Isn't it lovely - like moth er-o' pearl?" 

 " Oh, do you know about shells ?" cried Eva, eagerly. 

 "Miss King says I do," returned Dick, gravely. " I suppose she seeB a bump of conohology somewhere in my forebear!. Unfortunately, my marvellous capaoity for that .study has been entirely undeveloped." 

 "Oh, Mr. Devereux, you are making fun of us," giggled Miss King ; " I am sure you know a great deal about them." 

 " But that isn't your name, is it?" asked Eva, and added laughing, in explanation to Miss King, " It's my name." 

 ' No, is it really ?" exclaimed . Dick. "Why, perhaps we are related. I say. what was your father's name?'' 

 "Oh, could we be? Is it really your name ? My father's name was Dick-Diok Devereux 1" 

 " Why, that's your name, Mr. Deve reux !" exclaimed Mis3 King, with another giggle. "Isn't it quite romantio ? Are you her brother? I didn't.know^ you were Miss Devereux," she added. "I thought you must be Miss Howland." 

 "Brotherl" repeated Eva Devereux, looking dazed. 

 " No, no," said Dick, impatiently. " You probably haven't any brothers, but I expect 

 we are cousins. I was called Dick after roy father's cousin, who got married against his family's wishes and went off to Aus tralia with bis wif*�. One of the last things my father said to mi when I wae leaving England was, � You may runup against someone who knew poor Diok.' " 

 " Did they know he was dead ??' asked 

 . Miss Devereux. 

 " Yes-saw it in an old newspaper. But did your father come from England ?" 

 "Oh, yes, and I know his people w�re angry at his marrying my mother, and that is why she would not write lo tell them when I was .. born. Oh, is it really trueP I can show you letters my father wrote in England before he was married." 

 "Ob, let us all see them-do now 1" cried Mis� King. " Louisa," calling to her ; sister, " Isn't this just like a novelP Here's Mr. Devereux and Miss Howland, as we called her, found out that they are cousins, and have the same--" 

 " Come, let us go to Mrs. Howland," said Dick, taking possession of Eva. "You 

 shall let me have a look at these letters 

 when we get home." 

 " Ob, there is no doubt about it at all," he said to her later, when they had dis cussed the subject with Mrs, Howland, and were walking back towards the boats. They had outstripped the others, and were a good deal ahead. " And as we. are cousins it would be absurd not to call one another by our christian names. Yours is Eva, isn't it? Doesn't suityou a bit, but 

 no matter." 

 " Doesn'tit?" she asked, smiling. "Well, I am not always called that. My name is Evangeline, and Mrs. Howland often gives it me full. Some of the. sisters used to call me Lina, and the girls had all sorts of pet names for me." 

 "Well, I shall call you Angel," said Dick, unhesitatingly. 

 "Oh, how pretty I Will you really? Yes, it is the middle of my name. ' But i don't deserve it. It is too good for me." 

 "Try to deserve it, then. And by the way, you were going to tell me yesterday, . only you wouldn't speak to me then, of 

 .some mysterious mode of life you intend to ' adopt in Sydney. As your, only present ri relative, I consider that I have a right to 

 iconseht or disapprove of your intentions. ' What was the Beeret, Princess?" 

 "Oh, I can't tell you now," she said, smiling up at him brightly. " I doa't feel inclined to. I want you to tell mo all about Eogland and my family." 

 Dick's face clouded over a little. " Your 

 family?" he said. "None of jour people are left alive. I think that we--yep, we must be your nearest relations, and if I were you I wouldn't bo in a great hurry to know us. When people's ancestors have been well off, and they try to keep the ' same state and the same society, on dimi 

 : nished means, they--well, it's degrading." 

 " But you are not," hesitated Angel. 

 "Not degradedP Thank you. Well you see, I don't exactly belong to my people, thank goodness 1 My godfather adopted and brought me up, and I always intended to earn on honest living for my self. He's not a bad sort, my godfather. But your people.are all dead." 

 " All dead," sighed Angel, and then added, " Do you notice where we are walking?" 

 " On the sand," returned Dick. ' � What about it ? I see we are higher up than the way we went. That was pleasanter to walk on ; this is soft and heavy, and we have these hideous little stumpy bushes on our right. Would you rather go closer to the sea ?," 

 i - " No ; oh, no ! They were -telling me 

 that there used to be a line of light railway all aiong here, from tbe old quarry at the Bluff to the river and the town. / Now the sand hos blown over it, but a little way back I noticed a whee!, and look, there is a 

 bit of the line." 

 " So there ie. Then we are walking over a buried railway. Why do you look at me 

 like that?'' 

 She colored a little, and dropped her eyes. "I wanted to see if you would laugh or be . uninterested, or whether it would perhaps feel the same to you as to me. It seems so sad, so strange, to think of the sand blowing and blowing and covering up all this ; and then when you I said to me * Your people are all dead '-- " 

 " It was rather a rough way. to say it," said Dick, af ter a pause. " Have you beenL boping to find relations? How much did 3tOU know about yourself?" 

 "Oh , very little. I knew my father and mother had both died when I was a baby, and that she had left me with the good mother; �but it was only-when I was 18 that my mother's letter was given to me, and a few of my father's letters to her, with the marriage and baptismal certifi cates, and a few other things." 

 " Your mother's letter. To whom?" 

 " To me, for my 18th birthday. Fancy writing a letter to be read 18 years after ! Peor mother I " The girl's eyes filled with 

 tears. ? 

 " Did she die at the convent?" asked 

 Dick, gently. j 

 " Yes. Why were they all so angry with him for marrying her? Was it because she was a Catholic?" 

 "Partly, perhaps," said her cousin. " But I never heard very much about it, I was so young when it all happened. I believe your mother was a lady, and a very beautiful woman, very fascinating, at all events, and she had some money, too ; but your father's father had set his heart on marrying his only son into a family of title. He had been engaged even for some little time, and then my namesake lost his heart to your mother. I don't really know what her name was, but I daresay you do. Anyway, everybody seems to have been furious about it. I suppose the whole family of Devereuxes were insulted by being deprived of a connection with a noble family, and your parents cleared out 

 to Australia." 

 " A.nd both died within a year," added Angel sadly. " Sometimes I think I would give anything to have a sister or a mother, or someone very near tome." 

 .. You don't know," said Lick, rather bitterly. " Some people who have very near and dear relations would give any thing to be without them. Friends are better. You can choose them, or rather they.choose themslves by their fitness to be your friends. If they don't fit you can skake them off. Eolations . stick-BO do-" 

 "WhatP" 

 "Another sort of relations. Hallo! What's this ? A whole truck on our buried line ?" 

 i " Soit is. Let us wait here a little, olease, for the others. l am afraid Mrs. Rowland will be tirod. Tell me about the 

 English flowers, and the hedges, and the houses, and the big towns. Oh I and the birds, and the wild animale," 

 "Rather a large order," smiled Dick. " I'm afraid I don't know much about the flowers or birds, but I could tell you about London." 

 And this subjeot lasted till Mrs, Rowland caught them up. Dick offered her his arm to the boat, but she declared herself not at all tired by the walk, especially as it was now getting quite cool. She was, however, pleased to join in the conversation about England, which she had left when quite a child. She had taken a fancy to Dick, who 

 she said was a real gentleman,but without, 

 any airs or affectation, and she waa quite J ready to forgive him for the breach of con- ' 

 ventionality the evening of their arrival, guessing easily how it had happened. She had said but little to Angel on the subjeot after a few involuntary exclamations of surprise and concern, but it was enough to show the girl that she had committed un awares some flagrant offence against the rules of sooiety, and to make her very in I dignant with Dick for allowing her to do 

 it. Now it was all right, however ; he bad not been unkind, and she did not think he ever would be ; and he washer cousin. It was very nice.
