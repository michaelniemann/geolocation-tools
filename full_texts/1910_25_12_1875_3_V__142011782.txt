 CHAPTER VI. IHow HTE ENJOYED I~. ErGHT~EN months have passed.- My: Lord of Hartrey has-taken possession of his estate and his position amongst the aristo. craecy of his native land. It must .Je -confessed;that ' my lord' is not boa tone The men rate him low,' and he is looked upon as a scamp. At the clubs to which he lhas been admitted by-virtue of his position as a-Marquis and: a man of good family,l he is shunned. His language, wheri: lhe his in- hits cups,is by no means choice, and one night when hopelessly..drunk, he was, easily enough, detected clumsily, manipulating� the cards. In the hunting field he rides recklessly, and is noted for securing all the inibirigibly'uritam able-brutes he can get together; but his seat is said to be all very well for sticking on, but sadly looking, in ease and grace. Then he consorts with his grooms at Devercourt, and bhs orgies in the big stbe -~itable thei-e.

He his making the money fly in the most reckless fashion, scorning all the.conventional pleasures to which the people of his condition are- supposed :to,. be addiced, and, findina .amusement only.in tho.,ver.y, :lowest dobau cheries, for which he neglects: his wife, -the daughter of Lord Tremayne of Chacoombe, -and- one of the haughitiest beauties in England, who- tried to reform him but now heartily despises him., Altogether. he" hasd 6ouired a very ba;l name for Australia, the place respon sible for his total'demoralihation.
