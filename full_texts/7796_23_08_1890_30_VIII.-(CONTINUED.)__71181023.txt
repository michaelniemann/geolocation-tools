 Tragedy," &c.) 

 j CHAPTER VIII.-(CONTINUED.) 

 " There is no need, auntie. In a few days I shall have mother here. Harry telegraphed for her last night, and I'm sure she'll come, and father, too, if possible. And then it may not be many days-perhaps not a day-before Harry is back. Even if there should have to be a trial, he will not be kept. He will be let out-on bail, isn't it called, till the trial takes place." ' 

 " I'm not certain about that, my dear, but I hope that will be the- case, if there has to be a trial. .But I have great hopes, and so has your uncle, that there will be no need for a trial to clear him. I drove with your xincle to the lawyer's, and, just as he got out of the carriage, he' said, ' Tell Maggie not to fret. Suspicions are not evidence, and without evidence, a prima facie case can't be made out.' He would go straight to the lawyer ' without first coming here.; and, bad as his gout was early in the morning, he 

 didn't seem to feel it when l ieft him." 

 " But you hadn't heard about Harry ?" 

 ' " No, dear, but after seeing the paper your uncle guessed-and he hurried away at once." 

 " That was very good and kind of you both-'? and, oh, auntie ! it's such a comfort to me to 

 know that you and uncle believe in Harry's in? nocence," Maggie said,adding, "Will uncle come 

 here after he has 3een the lawyer ?" i M j 

 " Yes, I sent the carriage back for him ; but he is going first to see Harry. In fact, to be present at the hearing, if it could take place this morning; He had hopes of bringing Dr. Huston with him! But don't count too much on that, my dear," Mrs. Halliday added, seeing the flush of eagerness on Maggie's face. ; ; (; ' ,' ; i i 

 "Shall we go into the drawing-room, then� aunt, and wait there ? I can see the carriage 

 better from the window there." . ' 

 Maggie had been standing some minutes at the dressing-1 oom window, looking with strained eyes for a glimpse of the carriage when it came in sight. It was closed, and for a brief moment after it stopped her heart beat wildly with the hope that her husband was inside. The (hope died when she saw her, uncle: step out with a wrathful expression on his face, which changed to irritation as soon as iis foot touched the ground. . '� ?.]?.:.'?.? 

 " What a pity uncle got out, auntie. I'm afraid he has hurt his foot," Maggie said, crush ing down the pam of disappointment that seemed to make a choking lump in her throat. 

 The signs, of irritation, though not. of wrath, had all gone from Mr. Halliday's facewhen". he entered the drawing-room. He advanced to Maggie with almost a jaunty air, saying. "Welly little girl, are you ready to drive back with , us ?" 

 " Maggie is not coming to. us to stay, George, but, she will go home with us for an hour or two," Mrs. Halliday said; adding, "she and I both think it will be better for her to see the lawyer there than here." : , : 

 " Ye?, yes ; we settled that this morning, I thought, iny dear. The lawyer will be at the house by the time we get back," Mr. Halliday replied, adding to Maggie 

 "And now, my little girl, if you'll just put on your hat, we'll get away." 

 " But, uncle, you have something; to tell me first, haven't you?" Maggie said, in a quivering 

 voice. ... 

 " Not very, much, my dear. Not much at all, good or bad, except that the case is remanded till to-morrow morning-though what the deuce ( they expect to gain by doing that is more than I, can make out," Mr. Halliday said, waxing red. from an attempt to " stand at ease," and keep ; 

 the remnant of temper which remained intact after he drove away from the police court. But failing in both respects he sat down rather heavily on the chair nearest to him, and gave vent to his wrath, "Of all the scoundrelly things I ever heard that of drageing a man to court and then remanding him till something in the form of evidence can be raked up against him is the most scoundrelly." 

 What right have people in a free country-a free country, mark you, nota country of serfs-a country whose institutions have been founded on Magna Charta-what right, I say, have people to be subjected to such injustice ? If there is evi dence enough to arrest a man on, then it ought to be enough to try him on, and if not, he shouldn't be arrested at all. It's nothing less than a scoundrelly shame to deprive a man of his liberty in that way ; and I came very near telling the magistrates so to their faces. I did say as much to Willmot^ afterwards. . I said, 'Look here Willmot, how the- I'll not repeat the exact word. I used there-did you come to sign a warrant without as much evidence as you could put in the corner of your eye ?' And all he could say was that it ' looked suspicious, and, as the I police instituted it, he couldn't get out of it.' A pretty story that !? All [ can say is that if there's no way of getting out of doing a piece of rank injustice, then the sooner the law finds a way the better. And the devil take me if I don't.bring a motion before Parliament for that very purpose." 

 Mr. Halliday, I may re mark here, was a mem ber of Parliament, of many years' standing. 

 Having let off the Bteam in this fashion, Mr. Halliday added, in a milder t o ne, to Maggie 

 " Well,now, my dear, don't you think it's time we were starting? I shall be glad to get this confounded boot off, for it's playing the very deuce with m y 

 toe." 

 "Yes, uncle. I shall be ready in a moment," Maggie said, .rising to her feet as she spoke. But there was a wist ful Jook on her face that went straight to her uncle's heart. 

 " Why, : bless m y soul, I've forgotten to sive you ': your hus band's message ! He sent his love, and I can't say how many kisses-and he was not feeling the affair nearly so much as he e x pected. He thinks, too, that there's nothing whatever in the remand tobe alarmed about. In fact, it shows that the case is very weak. He's right there. It is weak, damnably weak - ex cuse me for using such a word. Well, you see, that being his opinion, it naturally makes him feel hopeful. The police are countingon getting some fresh evidence to bolster up their case but, as we know it's not to be erot, there's no 

 . need for fear. I was to tell you that, and to say Nthat'he� was sure .you would bear up, like a brave j little girl, till he comes back to you." 

 I ! J", Thank, you; uncle. I ; will try to be all he , thinks; me," Maggie said,.going to her;uncle and kisssing. him'. ; i 

 : >?/< That's right, my dear. , And now,; just run away, and put on your hat, and we'll gethome." 

 : As they were driving along,, Mr.' Halliday turned to Maggie, and, said 

 "I tried my best, or rather the lay wer did, for me, to get those scoundrels to take bail. I didn't care how high it went, . but it was no use. The police objected, and the remand was only for twenty-four hours, they said ; as if that could be a solid reason for refusing it." And then Mr. Halliday launched out into a fresh tirade against the injustice of law-court proceedings in cases of mere- suspicion, which. lasted till, he reached home.- ?' ?. . ,; ?::,.?!?} 

 .... \\ CHAPTER IX., 'V: 

 The newspapers the morning af ter Dr. Hilston's arrest contained very littler-fresh .information respecting the case which was attracting so much attention. A telegram from Solitary Island stated that the body of the woman, found on its shores, had been dispatched to Sydney. To that was added that it was expected to arrive some time in the evening. According to editorial opinion it was thought that immediately Dr. Hilston's case came on for hearine, the police would ask for a fresh remand, of at least twenty four, hours!" Yet, though this opinion was gene rally held, the court was ' crowded almost to suffocation, when the case was called. 

 Dr. Hilston was not required to stand in the dock, but occupied a position near the table, at which his lawyer was seated. The ciowd of spec tators, instead of the ferocious-looking criminal some at least. expected to find, saw a gentleman with a handsome, intellectual face, and a very dignified manner. :In features, expression, and attitude, nothing could have been less like the traditional murderer than.the man they found themselves gazing at. 

 As soon as the charge, which was one of sus picion only, was read an application was made by the police for a remand till the folio wing Monday. It was granted. This time, however, an applica tion for bail was not refused, though the amount required was very high. 

 On this morning Maggie waited at home, with less of hopefulness than on the preceding day, for her uncle's return from the court. The lawyer having been sure that a further remand would be asked for, there did not seem any possible room for hope that the case would be heard ; and, as bail had been previously ref used, it was thought scarcely possible that it would now be granted. 

 It was therefore a surprise, as well as a great joy, to see her husband instead of her uncle step from the carriage when it stopped at the door. It drove off as soon as Dr. Hilston alighted, and he entered the house alone. From his expression Maggie knew that the case was not over. The thought gave her strength to restrain her feel ings for his sake. And the meeting was therefore almost as quiet as the parting the day before had 

 been. 

 It was not till she had been some time in his arms that words of welcome were possible to her. Then in a low but full-toned voice she said 

 "Oh, Harry, it is good to have you back again !" . , 

 " It is only for, a few days, my dearest. The trial has yet to come," he replied, afraid from the joy in her tone that she believed it was at an 

 end. ? : ?"? - - ; . t;!,v. 

 " Tes, dearest,.but what of that? It;will only be for a little while you will leave me again-and then you will come back to me for good." 

 "I trust so darling. I can't see where the evidence for a prima facie' case is to come from, and it seems to me that the police are beginning to find out how poor a case .they have to go on. No doubt they are in hopes that something fresh . will turn up to help them. The finding of'the 

 body is not sufficient, or there would be rio need for a remand till Monday. It might just as well have come on for hearing to-morrow." ,, 

 "You think, then, that the body found at Solitary Island is-hers ?" 

 " I feel sure it is, dear." 

 "Then she couldn't have been drowned when she fell overboard ?" , . 

 " No, it is pretty certain that,, if picked up that night by a boat from the Susan Martin,she must have been alive. It' was too dark for the discovery, of a dead body." ' 

 " But-she might have died soon after ?" � < i 

 " I think not, dear. The telegram stated; that there were no marks of injury." The general: opinion, I have been told, isth�t she was drowned : 

 at the same time as the crew of the" Susan Martin.'" "'? - ' ' .. < 

 " Oh, Harry, dearest ! I am so glad, so thank ful !" Maggie exclaimed. . ; � ' 

 " VVhy,"dearest?" he asked. 

 " Oh, don't you see-won't everybody see^ that if she was taken out alive, even though she was afterwards- drowned, you can't be; accused:of causing her deata ?" ; 

 "But, my dear, the point.is-not, whether she was drowned then or afterwards, but whether or 

 not I threw her overboard. If she had been 

 actually saved and brought to Sydney alive, it would not have made much difference if they: prove that I did that," Dr. Hilston said.; then, seeing the eager hopefulness dying out of Maggie's face, he added 

 " My dear, I'm sorry to damp your hopes in this� way. But, you see, it is better to know-the truth ; than to build hopes on a wrong foundation. Still,j it doesn't follow that the real grounds for hope! are affected. They lie in the fact that conviction! 

 cannot be secured without clear evidence that I 

 did what I am charged, .on suspicion, of having: done. And that, we know, is an impossibility ; so" you see, dear, there is no need for fear of any-: thing approaching a committal, let alone , a con-, viction." . 

 " Yes, dear, I see that." , : , , 

 "But, dearest,there is just one, thing I; do fear, and that is the want of evidence to clear me entirely from suspicion. For that reason I have, once or twice, thought it would, perhaps; be better if the case did go on to a jury, t have an idea that .Wellman thinks so too, though he has not said it in so,many words. But, bard as the ordeal, for both, you and me,. it would be better to be tried by a jury and acquitted, then remain all my life under suspicion. Don't you think so?" . ,.? ; , 

 " Yes, Harry-yes. But, oh ! I do hope there will be no need. for it, Surely, it will be made clear that .you are innocent without a second trial." . . ,# . _ , , 

 " I trust'so.too, dearest.^ * But whatever comes -whether Jbhe. ordeal I haver Jio pass through be long or short, it will bV ajcy'a�d a -"comfort to me to know that/you retain, yourj faith ;in me." 

 '" You may have that to the full/dearest. For come, wbat may,fit will .never, change. If an', angel from Heaven came down, to say you/were, not innocent, I would not believe it,". ; Maggie. said, wit i glistening:.eyes/, and with her, arms clasped tight round her husband's neck. 

 " What a pity it is," she said, after a pause, " what a.great pity itis, Harry, thatithe captain's log book was �lost; It would have told about the rescue, and how the woman came to; be"in the' water-would it not?" �\\--> I ?-,?., y_\\ 

 "It would be sure to give an account of the rescue-and possibly some explanation to account for the need.of, it. But "^scarcely, think it would be the true one. You see, she would not be likely to say that she jumped overboard for the purpose of committing suicide.; If she gave -any -explana tion at all-and one of'some kind must have been asked for-she would most likely set it down as 

 an accident." :.,-:;.: 

 " Even then it would have helped to clear you. Don't you think so ?" ; ' 1 / �1 

 "Yes; I have no doubt it would do that if it were forthcoming." 

 "Oh, then, I do hope it will be found, It is possible that it may yet-don't you think, Harry ?" .. , 

 " Yes, quite possible. The sea has a trick of casting up things believed to have been lost for ever, in her broad bosom! It is possible that Cap 

 �U ^,ame^3's book may be picked up ; but 

 whet er it will be in a condition to furnish evidence is not so certain." 

 " At any rate we may hope that it will, dear." 

 "With all my heart,. dearest," Dr. Hilton Baid; and then, having kissed each other once �nore, they talked of other things. Maggie told 

 him that she had received a telegram from her brother Jack. It stated that her father and mother and sister had started for Sydney, and might be expected to arrive on Saturday after noon. He had added in his boyish way 

 " Let me know if I am wanted, and I'll come. Bob is out back, or he would say the same. Sym pathy and best wish for a speedy end to the 

 trouble." 

 "That is just like Jack. And I'm sure Bob would have said the same," Maggie remarked, with a little quiver in her voice, when her hus band had rf ad the telegram. And the quiver had brought moisture into her eyes, when she added 

 ?vd�fThey^aireb�tlvdear, kind-hearted boys,though some people ^niight-' think them a little rough in their mann'ek�'- *.' ; '< 

 They^are';just what you have called them, kind-hearted boys;-and; as they should be, they are very*fond; of their Bister/ Meg," Dr. Hilston said: � And, somehow, the telegram and the talk about it had cheered them up wonderfully. In spite of the dark cloud tr��ging over them, they, felt, happy. ; ; , , 

 On Saturday evening. Mr. and Mrs. Morlands and their .daughter Josephine arrived. They bad learned from the telegrams sent to the Brisbane papers the cause of Maggie's trouble, and among other things of Dr. Hilst en's arrest. It was therefore a great relief to them to see him walk on board: when the steamer reached the wharf, in company with Mr. Halliday. 

 " It is not all over yet," Dr. Hilston said, as he took Mr. Morland's outstretched hand, in reply to 

 ' the other's eager look of inquiry. Then, aa h� 

 turned to the ladies, he added, briefly 

 � ** The case is remanded till Monday. I'll tell you all about it when we get home." 

 I " Yes, and a most scoundrelly attempt to take 

 away an innocent man's character, you'll say it is, Morland, when you hear.it," Mr. Halliday said in an explosive burst, as he shook hands all round. : ? 

 "Well, now," he added, when they had reached the spot where his carriage stood, " you four go in the carriage, and I'll follow in a cab. My wife is with Maggie, waiting for you at the doctor's. 

 And after we've had a talk we'll settle where you are all to stop." V " ' < ' : 

 Some demur to his-going in a. cab was made, first by Dr. Hilston, arid then, by Mr. Morland, to 

 which he added- . 

 " No, I'd sooner go in a cab/it's easier to get in and out of, as yo'A'd find if you had a gouty toe. 

 Besides, I'll nob.jrvn any risk of .Miss Jo flopping 

 on that saine totM 

 Mr. Halliday'swaugfc, as he hailed a cab; might have beena little forced, but it was very pleasant to hear, notwithstanding. 

 Some time after the long talk had come to an end, Jo found herself alone with her sister, and her pent up feelings at once found expression. -
