SOME TH ING TO HIS ADVANTAGE.:* '--[- ]-.-- BY nInoMoxD TIHATCHER.] (PbZlished by Special Permnisasionof the Author.) CAIPTER III. How Hz WaNT APrB IT. TIlHE inevitable 'next morning' so well Z known to all who let the insidious enemy into their brain camp to rout reason, came; and the sun rose over the Gingi Gingi, light ing up that impetuous creek, the peaks far beyond, and the plain before the door of the ' Dead Finish.' Every bit of mica in the boulders shone like a diamond, and 'even the wiry grass that fought its way through the rough stones looked inviting. The cattle turned out in the direction of a bar across the creek that stopped its passage; and made it from a clear pool, with a bottom of green stones, slate, and quartz pebbles. The sun glinted over tile surface of this pool, and the contrast with the ironstone and black sand on the banks was beautiful to see. The dogs had not yet become the role property of the distressing heat of later in the day, or the fleas, and were able to have miniature boar bunts with the pigs, who stood sometimes at bay and grunted defiance, and at others ran ignominiously for protection under the house, or entrenched themselves behind the water cask. As the orb of day, (to be hackneyed,) got further on with its terrible work, no one stirrea butthe Chinaman, who cooked break fast for himself alone, knowing that he would not be troubled for food till at least the middle of the day. 'Yankee Sam' had got in his horses, saddled up, filled his water bags, and packed his mails before daylight; and had gone off leaving a trail of tobacco smoke behind him. The blacks had not left their eamp, for experience told them that there would be nothing for them to do or get till the revellers were about; and though they had eaten their grass-seed cakes and grubs and lizards for breakfast hours ago they were aid ing digestion by crooning the inevitable hymn tune with nsuch exasperatingly few variations, Inside the delectable hostlery even ' Irish Bill' slept, for his potations like those of the rest had been deep and frequent. ' Old Daddy' was ,the first to move, being recalled to momentary consciousness by a kick from his nearest neighbour. He only swore a few eathe, however-turned over and resumed his stertorousbreathing and deep sleep. Presently the hejof Hartrey opened his eyes and realized the situation. He tried to pillow his head again on " Chopping Harry's body, but that individual had sufficiently slept off his stupor to feel the pressure; and he rolled aside anrd let the lordly head thump the hard boards of the "Dead Finish." Then he sat up and looked at Hartrey, who returned his glance. ' Pretty rough time last might,' was Harry's Sirst exolamation. ' So I should say. I feel like a dead man. Caurse the drink. I wonder tf there's any rum shout ?' 

 They both got up, and after searching for a : measure, drew some rum from a keg, and eahob . had a pull, making wry faces, as the raw stuff Sburnt their throats ? Ah that's better-what do you say to a swim ?' said Hartrey. ' Or a long ride,' rejoined Harry. * I shall have a touah of D.T.'s if I don't shake these blues off.' .'Right,' maid the other. I suppose Bill won't.mind me taking his grey mare now i she .unsm over in the bend. You get " Old Daddy'e" -roan, and we'll shake the devil out of us. I!Better still-give Yarry a couple of bridles and let him bring the mokes up while we have ?--aluiee.' A loud "e' ooey" and a call for " Yarry," brought several natives to the door of the humpy; and on being promised a drink they h-irriedl off towards the direction where they k�new well the horees would be found. SThe young men borp pretty plain evidence .of their debauch in their eyes and on their in. :Iamnedfsoaes. In stature and appearance as they made hurried preparations for their ride, they.somewhat resembled each other. Both were somewhat slight'and museular, both typi eally English, hazel-eyed, rudy-eomplexioned though sunburnt, and with an evident trace of N'orman blood in their veins. Their alfresco toilet coonsisted of a rinse in a rude bowl, hollowed by the natives out of the boll of a treei and the passing through their brown hair of their 'ngers. Their dress, too, was of the same description, except that in addition to boots and mole.skins " Chopping Harry," wore - shirt on which horses at full speed were run miag a desperate race on a ark chooolate coU-se, while " The Swell's" was of a pale lilao, ,the olor having been nearly dispossessed by the sun, which had left it almost white. S.Having recompensed the aboriginal posse� ors of the soil for.their labour by giving them a rood.stiff gl?ss each of soul-destroying 1 o such as is only seen in the far bush, he .nmustered up saddles and equipage, strapped on the indeapensible water-bags, took *** A Caeratse BDoo, published by Turew pad Uaadroq, Hlenter-treet, Sydnepy Price, 2.. 

 a spsr eaelh"from the heels of the reoumbent SHong Kong Jack,' who:lay .unconscious of the process, and were ready for their ride. Their horses were'in good fettle for the Gulf, for they soon get acclimated,. and. adapt themselves to the nature of the country, and the work re quired from them. ' May I hold your lordship's stirrup ?' said Barry, mok-heroically ; ' or shall we aecoutro some of these knightly retainers, and let them follow your lordship to the field ?' ' LNo, - it ! Let us start,' said the other, testily. ' Wait till I get to Dever court, where my studs are, and I'll have lots of flunkeys to do either one or the other. Fill that Worcester bottle with rum, for we may want it before we get back.' This done, the pair mouated lightly into their saddles, put a spur into their horses, and went up the little hill leading to Nanangil. At the top they halted. 'Let us go over towards the Albert,' said Harry. '.Hlong Kong says there's some fine country between this and there. He was out after a mob of blacks that speared BSilly the Ccok's horses. Navy Colt was with him and he swears the niggers are like sheep on the billybongs. WTe may have a pop at some of them.' 

 'No! hang 'em; it isn't good enough now,' rejoined Hartrey. * Life, I expect, is as pre e?ious to them as to us, though they do eat grass-seed and snakes, bones and all.' SCuss the beggars I say, was the response. 'Fetch 'cm down every chance,' is my motto What's the good of the black brutes? Only keep white men off the country. But what with black police, sub-inspectors, and squatters, they won't be thick very long.' ' Well, well,' said Hartrey, 'the country's served our turn, and let those do the shooting who are to profit by it. We've got our revol vers and enough cartridges in case we should want them ; but I won't go off my way to clear niggers off for others.' 'All right, then; the Albert's the word, off wego. I've got old Nick up behind me already.' - Down then they went, off the road, and struck away to the westward, leaving the Gingi Gingi, and going across a wild, pic turesque, broken country, consisting of ridges, of porphyry with quartz pebbles, thinly grassed, the horses picking their way care fiully, little heeded by their riders, who were deep 'in thought. An hour's smart riding brought them to a 'divide' between too large streams, where the country was better, and in some parts timbered with heavy box and large gums. Then they scampered till the tall trees came in sight which marked the course of the Flinders, whose banks were sixty feet deep. but enclosed only a few broken chains of water-holes in its bed. The other line of trees denoted the presence of the Gingi Gingi, which here joined the Flinders. At the junction they crossed by a ford, for the two streams kept the bed covered, and the water tumbled over giant rocks of granitic stone and across a bar of sand and pebbles, and with difficulty. they get through the long grass and strong vines on the banks. There were signs of blacks here and it was evidently a well frequented camping place, for their tools and implements were there-small fish nets, waddles for throwing, bowls and rounded stones for grinding seeds, and sheets of bark bent over for huts: quite a native village. Part of the Creek, too, was dammed with the bark of tea tree and sand and bushes thrown intoit to poison the water so as to kill the fish ; and a number of fires showed that the blacks were about. Here they left the Flinders finally, and pushed along through a fine heavily-timbered flat of red gum and box, well covered with blue grass and of rich soil, After they had came to a succession of hillooks of carboniferous which divided the good country from a semi-desert covered with shrubs of the lovely desert pea-clianttuos Dampierii-with its gorgeous red flowers and purple-blackoentre. Then came a vast plain of miles in diameter circled with trees, evidently an old lake bed, the soil being rich and of chocolate colour, but cracked and rent in vast fissures by the sun, and requiring careful riid ing. The outer circle reached, a vast salt-pan stretched itself as far as the eye could see, and as soon as they got fairly on to it a mfrage presented itself, and they saw lakes and castles and lovely parterres. They had been riding pretty hard up to this, and here they pulled up and had a sip from the Worcester bottle and a drink from the water bagas 

 ' I've been thinking,' said * The Swell,' 'of my uncle and Trem.--my cousin: he was called Tromayne, aftea Lord Tremayne of Chacoombe Priory. I'm sorry they got killed, though I Ihave come into the estate. You wonder to see me out here, knocking about as a station hand. Doyou know England?' 'I should say so,' said Harry, ' I ought to.' ' Well, perhaps, you don't know the curse of being well born, and having no coin-the curse of primogeniture, and the caste observed worse than among the Hindoos. Hartrey, the head of our family, was a rich man-very rich, with lots of land, and a big income from Hartrey Moors and the Cinderbank lands: a fine mansion in Belgravia, a yatching plane at Cowes, and a big castle at Devercourt, which are all mine now. But we had nothing. My father, the Honourable George Hartrey, had only about �1500 a year, and was always bad off, for it was'nt enough for my mother and the girls. We had to keep good society on nothing. Not but what Hartrey and Trem, were very good. But you see, in England a fellow may be very poor, and he can't take money, though he wants it ever so badly; and so I was always looked upon as a sort of poor beggar, and had to put up with all sorts of inconveniences. I had no title even to sell :to a tallow-chandler's or cotton-spinner's daughter for a a swag of money and I couldn't go to work. So, though I was always welcome at IHartrey or Devereourt, and had the run of uncle's places in town or at the seaside, and all that, I could never stand my position. I got into a marching .regiment. but barrack life with its cadish sprees and invites to cheap feeds was as bad as society, and I out it and went to India and roamed-I won't say where. Ir've been awtully hard up; and, Harry, upon my soul I was a turnkey once, and in 'aranakli I rented a billiard table, and I met a fellow 'Atherton (who used to visit Hartley, and was sweet on Trem's sister Clara, and was encour. aged till his uncole, the Marquis of Boearsdale, married a French dancer, who brought him an heir)-riving a trap for a livery stable keeper. Iv'e wandered- about -recklessly,. better pleased, though, at this life than~ hanging on half-in half-out of th'i riqg-fence of English tno till I got herew, the last place God 

 made. I havn't written home for years; but I can soon get the title of estates, for I left all my papers and diary at Port Denison when I came here, at Wright's place. My word I won't I have a spree? But i mnst kfriock, off grog, thouph-for Lord Hartrey must'nt be a rowdy, whatever Cecil Hartrey was I'll keep such hounds and horses, and astonish the fellows with yarns about Australia. How came you horse-break ing and shearing ?' Well,' said Harry, 'it's rather strange, but my history is somewhat like your own, in it's small tin-pot way. I too, was brought up in society of a certain style. My mother was ,housekeeper to a country gentleman and aman of title; and she being an old servant, I was allowed to stop in the house-Fairacres -for my father was shot by poachers while protecting the game.- When I was a kid I used to associate with the young swells about, and used to go shooting and fishing with them, for I was a good sportsman, and knew the covers and pools as well as the keepers, and I used to feed with them and be like one of them until I grew up and was big enough to be snubbed. SirArthur Hardgrave, the boss. 

 wauted to put me to some respeotabile trade, but I was about as fit for it as if I had been born wi*h as big a spoon down my throat as any of them. After getting into one scrape and another, I went into the service like you, only I was ' before the mast' as they say at sea, for I enlisted. If the mess-room and the fal-de-lals at parties wern't to your taste, you can guess how I liked furbishing up belts, mounting guard,' and being spoken to like a dog by the officers-fellows for the most part of not half my worth, scamp as I was. So I soon got out of it-I need'nt say how; but I went abroad, and knocked about on a ranche near Rio; then to the States; afterwards over on the mines in California and Nevada, sometimes making a haul, and at others put to queer shifts for tucker- I was on the Victorian and New Zealand diggings for a bit, but they were done for " hatters" and chaps without money to go in for big work, when I got there; and I took to the sea, and it was in the old Gazelle I got to the Gulf, for I landed in that dog hole at Burketown on the Albert. I didn't come across by Landsborough's track, and I'll be hanged if ever. I go back that way when I leave, though I'm blessed if I know when that will be~' 

 S'You shall come with me,' said Hartrey. 'I'll never forgethow you stood by me when that thief Bill Murphy barred me out yester day. I'll be able to give you something to do superintending my nags at I)avercourt; and you can knock about with me as my chum. I won't siub you.' Thanks,' Harry'replied,' 'if I can earn my grub, and a few pounds to pay my way, I don't mind. So I'll think about it. ' (To BEgiCONTINUED.)
