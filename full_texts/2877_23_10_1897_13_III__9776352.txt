THE LAST FARE. 

 A MELBOURNE DETECTIVE STORY. 

 By C. H. CHOMLEY. 

 CHAPTER III. 

 "There's no place like home," I whistled with less tune than sarcasm, as standing at the window I watched Dorothy walk down the street. My home-coming was certainly not a cheerful one, to find when I had scarcely been here a day one friend dead, another suspected of causing her death, and a third, whom I valued most filled with angry scorn for me. The last blow was the hardest to bear, especially as I had partly brought it on myself. 

 Forgetful of the hour and the sacredness of Mrs Blake's drawingroom, I flung myself 

 upon the sofa and lit a cigar. Life was a very unattractive business, and I did not feel at all inclined to sustain it with the eggs and bacon which Mrs Blake came to inform me severely had been waiting for me in the diningroom this half-hour. However, I finished my breakfast somehow, and made my way towards the station, determined to look up some old friends at the club and to keep my eye open for a mate with whom to wander again when my part in this wretched mystery should be finished. 

 A hansom cab stopped near me in the road, and a voice from it called, "Is that you, Mr Winton? I was just off to your diggings to look you up." 

 It was Sinclair, the very man I did not want to see, for I was anxious to forget the Dandenong-road omnibus and everything connected with it for a time, but fate ruled 

 otherwise. 

 Sinclair was on his way to the inquest, and invited me to accompany him. 

 "Is my presence necessary?" I asked. 

 "Yes, you will be wanted," he answered. "though probably the inquest will be just formally opened and adjourned. You had better jump in and come with me." 

 Very unwillingly I did so. 

 "Where are we going?" I asked him, as the cab, instead of going down to St. Kilda road, turned up High-street. 

 "To Mr Corfield's place, Fairfield-house," he replied, "where the inquest is to be." 

 I was surprised at this, as I thought inquests were always held at the morgue, and relieved, too, for I had never wished to see the inside of that ironically cheerful-looking building by the Yarra bank. 

 Sinclair laughed when I told him. "That is the general rule," he said, but perhaps Mr Corfield has friends in the Crown Law office. At any rate, an exception has been made, and the coroner's court sits at Fairfiel- house this morning." 

 altogether he seemed very cheerful, and I asked him the reason. 

 "Well, in my profession, Mr Winton, one likes lo be in a big thing," he said. "This 

 is a very big thing, and it will be a neat conviction 

 on circumstantial evidence if the prisoner does not spoil it by a confession." 

 "You are certain of a conviction then?" 

 "Well, yes. everything points that way, though there are difficulties," he said thoughtfully, filling his pipe. "I must confess there are difficulties; but, of course, you haven't heard the latest evidence." 

 "You mean the handkerchief?" I said. 

 Sinclair looked at me with surprise. "You have heard that then? Yes, the handkerchief 

 is most valuable, but we have the chloroform bottle, too." 

 The surptise wa on my side when he mentioned this, and he seemed gratified by 

 the fact. 

 "Ah! then there is something you don't know, after all," he said with a smile. 

 "I certainly have heard nothing of that," I answered. "Tell me about it." 

 "I had been hoping against hope that Cunningham was innocent, and as Sinclair gave me the account of his arrest the reality of what his guilt meant presented itself as a mental picture which I did not care to look 

 upon. 

 When they went to his house to make the arrest, Sinclair told me, Cunningham was at his breakfast. He showed no surprise, and made no resistance but professed to be certain that he could prove his innocence. After the usual caution that anything he said might he used against him at his trial, 

 Sinclair showed him the handkerchief, and asked him if he had ever seen one like it. 

 "Did he know where it had been found?" I asked Sinclair at this point. 

 "You may bet he knew well enough," he answered, "but no one had told him. I took care that no newspaper should get into his house this morning." 

 "All right." I said, "go on," and Sinclair resumed his narrative. 

 "Fulton examined the handkerchief, and said that if very much resembled one of three that he had in his possession, a present from a friend who had bought them in India as a specimen of specially fine silk. Asked where they were, he replied that he believed they were at the bottom of a drawer in his room, but that it might be a year or more since he had used them. 

 "The police searched the drawer and found in it two handkerchiefs, identical in every respect with that in their possession. Before he was removed to the Melbourne Gaol a search was made of the clothes he wore. Nothing but a cigarette case, a little money, a pipe and tobacco and a few letters were found in them.There was nothing in any way material to the case; but the first thing that Sinclair discovered in the pocket of an overcoat, which Cunningham admitted wearing on the previous night, was a small bottle , empty, without a cork, bearing on one label the word "Chloroform", and in another below it the name of Gould and Oliver, chemists, in Bourke- street, Melbourne. 

 "What did Cunningham say to that?" I asked. 

 "For the first time since I had seen him 

 he showed signs of uneasiness and seemed to lose his nerve," said Sinclair, "but of course he professed the utmost lgnorance of how the bottle carne there. He asked to see the bottle, and after looking at it was going to make some remark but checked himself, saying that he would reserve anything 

 he had to say till his trial. He will find it difficult lo explain then, I fancy." 

 "Did he, as a fact, buy chloroform at Gould and Oliver's?'' I asked. 

 "Not lately, it appears. They have just begun a new poison register, and the old one is with some other books at the Safe Deposit. They have sent for it for me. Of course, he may have bought the chloroform months or years ago, and he gets olher things there." 

 Where is he now?" I asked. 

 "On his way ftom the gaol to the inquest, if he is not there by this time," said Sinclair, looking at his watch. "By Jove, we are late. Whip up a bit, cabby," he called months or years ago; and he gets other 

 his cane. 

 There were many other things which I wanted to ask Sinclair, but we were getting near Corfield's house, and a minute afterwards we drove through the open gates of Fairfield-house. 

 "Here we are," said Sinclair. "I shall have half-an-hour to spare after the inquest if you care to talk things over with me at the barracks." 

 The wide verandah was already dotted with people-jurymen, reprters, and servants belonging to the house. I had never been in it before, and it struck me forcibly under what different circumstantes from those which I had planned I was about to make its acquaintance. 

 All the blinds were down; the door into the big hall was open and voices speaking in a Iow tone came from the smoking-room, where the coroner, Corfield, and one or two solicitors and barristers were waiting for Sinclair. Corfield recognised me when I entered, and bowed. He would have shaken hands, I think, but Dorothy Lister's account of him induced a coolness in my manner which he was quick to notice and reciprocate. sinclair spoke a few words to the coroner, who seemed out of temper and impatient, after which there was a general move to the diningroom - a huge apartment opening from the hall on the righthand side as one entered by the front door. 

 The first thing that struck my attention was a full length portrait of Mrs. Corfield 

 

 in her wedding dress, beautiful and characteristic, which hung over the mantelpiece. A moment later I noticed Cunningham seated by the window, with a constable standing on either side of him. As I was debating whether I should recognise him or not, a solicitor who was watching the case on his behalf engaged his attention, and I don;t think he noticed my presence. 

 

 Tht great diningroom table was placed across the room at one end, with chairs round it for the coroner, the court officials, and the press. Five chairs in a row stood against the wall to accommodate the jury, 

 and others had been placed in the body of the room for such members of the public as were present at the ceremony. I took one beside Sinclair in the front row. The coroner had taken his seat, the jurors were in their places, and all seemed ready to begin, but still there was a pause. I turned to ask Sinclair what we were waiting for, and at the same time the coroner whispered something to Corfield who nodded in reply 

 and left the room. 

 "We are waiting for Mrs Corfield," said Sinclair in answer to my question, "the 'fons et origo,' as they say in Latin, of the whole affair. Don't you know that an inquest without the body would be 'Hamlet' with Hamlet omitted? The jury must be sworn in its presence." 

 I did not like Sinclair's flippant style and said no more. A second afterwards we heard a heavy measured tramp in the hall outside, and six men entered carrying on their shoulders a stretcher, on which lay the bodv of Mrs Corfield still dressed exactly as I had seen her on the previous 

 night. 

 The footsteps of the bearers were noiseless on the heavy carpet, and there was one of the most intense silences I have ever felt as, at a sign from Corfield, who walked beside them, they put down the stretcher by the wall underneath the window, opposite the jurymen's seats. The room was very dark but at the request of the coroner, the venetians were raised and a flood of light streamed across the face of the young woman who had so often sat, perhaps in that very dress, laughing and talking at the head of the table where a court of justice 

 was sitting now to inquire into the 

 cause of her death. 

 1 looked at Cunningham and Corfield, the two men who must feel the situation most. Corfield stood near the head of the slretcher, his eyes resting on Ins dead w�fe's face and not a motion ot his eyelids nor a muscle of his countenance betrayed the slightest emotion. His expression was grave and dignified, beyond that impenetrable. Cunningham, who stood where I had seen him first - not far from the stretcher - bent one long searching look upon the dead woman's features. From them he glanced quickly to the portrait on the wall. 

 Then he buried his face in his hands and tried to stifle what sounded like a sob. 

 The coroner left his seat, and stood before the stretcher. At a word from some court officer, the jurors also crossed the room, and stood besido him looking at the body. 

 This, Sinclair whispered to me, was the official view, a necessary preliminary to all 

 inquests. 

 "Though it would have been just as effective, and more decent," he added, "if they had retired to another room to have a peep 

 at her."
