 musing inTa calculation concerning a race, John C often wondered at the strange ease with ilticli he had earned out so monstrous and ;�mmgly difficult an imposture Landed in ^diiev by the vessel vi Inch Sarah Purfoy had satt to save bim, he found himself a slave to a bondage scarcely le� balling than that from which lie had escaped-tlio bondage of enforced r"m.anionship with ntl unlived woman The oniiortuno death of one f her usMgucd servants Md enabled Sarah Purfoj to m"lul tho esc iped Lonvictiu his room In the strange state of society which p evaded of necessity in Now South Wales at that period, it vv es not unusual for assigned servants t> many among the fiec settlers, and w heu it was lie ird that Mrs Purfoj, the widow of a whaling captain, had ni lined Juhn Cm, her storekeeper, tranipoited for embezzlement, and with two years of lus sentence yet to run, noone eipessed surprise Indeed, when, the jen after, lohn Carr blossomed as au " e\\piree, mastei of a fiue vvifo anda fine foi tune, theit were in ui} about lum who would h iv o made his omtence in Austiaha Tilt uaut enough But John Rex had no notion of remaining longei thau he could help, and ceaselessly sought means of escape fiom this second prison house 1 or a long time his seat eli was unsuccessful Much as she loved tho �cottudrcl, Sarah Purfoy did not scruple to tell lum that she had bought linn, and regudid linn as her property He knew that if he made any attempt to escape from his in u nage bonds, tho noniiu who hld risked so mu li to save linn would not hesitate to deh\\ ei lum ov er to tho authorities, and Btato how the oppot tuno death of fever stricken John Cul hid enabled her to give name and omploynient to absconded John Hex He had thought unto th it the fact of het being his wife would prevent her from giving evidenco against linn, and that ho could thus defy kel But she reminded lum that a word to Blunt would be all sufiicieiit 

 'I know you don t en o foi mo now, John, ' she saul, with grim coinpliceucy , ' but join life is ni my hinds, aud it }ou desert me I will bring you to the gallows

 powerful, and he could but wait until her death or some lucky accident would rid lum of hci, and leave lum flee to follow out the scheme ho had matured " Once ntl of her, he thought, in his solitary rides over the statten of which ho was the nominal owner, "and tho rest is easy I shall return to Engl uni with a plausible story of shipwreck, and shall doubtless bo received with open nrniB by tho dear motkei from whom I Im\\o been so long parted Richard Devino thill have his own aL/uu

 Once �-scaped from tin aldom, he pioceedcl to play for the treat stako of his life with the utmost caution He went to tho Continent and 

 lived for weeks together m tho towns where Richard Devine might possibly have lestded, familial laing himself with streets, making the wqttamtauco of old inhabitants, di awing into his omi hands all loose ends of information which coull help to knit tho meshes of his net the closer Such loose ends vvero not numerous , ti� piodigal had been too poor, too insignificant, to leave strong mcmones behind htm Yet Re-v knew well by what strluge accidents the deceit of au assumed identity is often penetrated Some old comrade or companion of the lost hen intfelit suddenly appear with keen questions as to tlio memory of trifles which vvt uld cut his flimsy web to shreds, as easily as the swoitl of Sdulm divided the floating silk He could not afford to ignoiethe most lnsignifiemt cucum stances With consummate skill, piece by piece he built up the story which was to deceive tho poor mother, and to ni ike him possessor of one of the hugest private foi tunos m England 

 This vv is the tile he hit upon Ho li id been 'ived from the burning Hydaspes bv a vessel hound foi Rio Ignorant of tho death of Sir Richard, and prompted by the pride winch was known to be a leading feature of his character, he Ind determined net to return until fortune Miould have bestowed upon him wealth at le ist c nuil to tho inheritance from which he had been ousted lu Spanish America he-had Bh iv en to accumulate that wealth m vam As KIOHCIO, tru oller, speculator, sailor, ho had toiled for fourteen ye 1rs, and had f uled Worn out and I10"1'01}*, he had returned home to beg a corner of Lngliili earth m which to lay his weary bones Hie tale vvvs plausiblo enough, and at the telling of it ho was armed at all points There was little fear that the navigator of tho captured O Prey, the man who had lived in Chill aud 

 cut out cattle on the Currum Plains, would prove lacking in knowledge of riding, seaman snip, or Spanish customs Moreover, ho had determined upon a course of action which snowed his knowledge of human nature 

 the will undei which Richard Devino inherited 

 was dated in 1807, aad had been made evidently when the testator was m tho first hopeful glow ot paternity By its terms Lady Ellinor Dev me was to receive n life interest of �3000 a year m ner husband s property-which was placed m the tonus of two trustees-until her eldest son 

 ,, or attained the age of 25 years When ctmer of these events occurred, the property was V0iftn�^llaet1, u�y EUinor receiving a sum of �100,000, which, invested in Consols for her ueneat would, according to mercantile Sir monard s prudent calculation, exactly compen- sate for her loas of interest, the remainder going absolutely to the son if living, to his children or next of kin if dead Tho trustees appointed were Lady Elhnoi's father, Colonel 7T Wade and Mr Silas Quaid, of the firm ot I urkiss and Quaid, Thanes Inn, Sir Richard'B � *�ra Colonel Wade dying, appointed, with ijuaid s consent, hu own son, Mr. Francis Wade, i J Ia hla BteaJ When old bachelor Quaid lied, the firm of Pukiss and Quaid (represented in the Quaid branch of it by a smart London urea nephew) dec med farther responsibility , and, with the consent o� Lady Eilinor, Francis " fe continued alone m his trust Sir Richard'B �"ter and her husband Anthony Frere of unstol, were long ago dead, and, ns wo know, their representative, Maurice Frere, content at ia,t in the lot that fortune had sent him, had

 given up all thought ot meddling with his uncle's business- John Rex, therefore, in the person of the returned Richard, bad but two persons to satisfy, hu putative uncle, Mr Francis Wade, and hu putative mother, Lady 

 Elhnor Devine 

 Tina he found to be the easiest task possible Francis Wade was an invalid virtuoso, who detested business, and whose ambition waa to be known as a man of taste The I issesaor of a email independent income, he hid resided at North End ever since his father s death, and had succeeded in making the place a ?'Ort of nunn turo Strawberry Hill When he icceded to his Bisters urgent wish, and assumed the sole re sponsibihty of the estate, he put al! the floating capital into 3 per cents, and was e intent to see the interest accumulate. Lady Elisnor had never recov ered tho shock of the circumsUncea attend mg Sir Richards death, and, clinging to the belief in her eon's existence, chose to regard herself as tho mere guardian of his interests, ready to bo displaced at any moment by his sudden return The retired pan lived thus togethei, and spent in charity and btic librae about a fouith of their mutual income By both of thom tho return of tho wanderer was hailed with a positivo delight To the Lady Ellinor it meant the wonderful reahs ition of a life long hope which had becomo part of her nature To Francis Wade it meant the ble Bed relief from a responsibility which his simplicity ilways secretly loathed, tho responsibility of looking after another person s money 

 "I shall not thiuk of interfeiing with the arrangements which you have made, my dear uncle, bald Mr John Rex on the first night of his iception " It would bo most ungrateful in mo to do so My wants aro very few, and can easily be supplied I will seo your lawyers Bomo day and settle it ' 

 " See them at once, Richard, seo them at once I am no mun of business you know, but I think you will find all right ' 

 But Richard put off the visit from day to day He desired to have as little to do with lawyors na possible He had resolved upon his course of action He would get money from his mother fir lmuicdiito needs, and when that mother died he wuu d assert full rights " My rough life li is unfitted mo for draw mg rooms, dear mother, he said " Do not lot there be a display about my return Giv e me a corner to smoko my pipe and lam happy ' Lady Devine, vv lth a lov a\\� tender pity, for which John Rex could not alt gether account, consented, and " Mr Richaid noon carno to be regarded as a martyr to circumstances, a man conscious of his own imperfections, and one whose imperfections w ero therefore to be lightly dw elt upon So the re turned prodigal had his on n stiito of rooms, bia own servants, his own bank account, drank, smoked, and was merry 

 For five or six mouths ho thought himself in Paradise Then he began to find his life in Biitferably weary Tho burden of hypocrisy is very heavy to bear, and Ret was compelled to perpetually boar it His mother demanded all his time She hung upon his lips , �he made him repeat fifty times tho story of his vv inder ings She was nover tired of kissing linn, of weeping over him, of thanking him for tho "sacrifice he had made for her "We promised nev er to spenk of it more, Richard, ' tho poor 1 idy said one day, " but if my life long lov e can make atonement for the wrong I hav e done you -' " Hush, dearest mother, ' said John Rex, who did not in the least comprehend what it was all about, " Let us say no moro ' Lady Ellinor wept quietly for o while and then went away, leaving tho man w ho pretended to be her son much bewildered and a little frightened T here was somo secret between Lady Dev ino and her son the which he had not fathomed Tho mother did not again refer to it, und gaming courago as tho days went on, Rex gievv bold enough to forgot all fears 

 lu tho first stages of his deception he had been tur d and cautious Then tho soothing influence of comfort, �espect, and security carno upon linn and almost refined him He began to feel almost as ho had felt when Mr Lionel Ciofton was alive The sensation of being rainibtcie 1 unto by a loving woman, who kissed lum night uid morning, c illing him " son, '-of being regarded with admiration by rustics, w lth envy by respectable folk-of being deferred to lu all things-was novel and pleasing They were BO good to htm that he felt at times moro than half inclined to onfess all, and le ive his caso in tho hands of tho folk he had injured Yet-ho thought-such a course would bo absurd It would result in no I enefit to my one, Biinply m misery to himself Iho ti ne Richard Devine was bulled fithoms deep m tho gieedy ocean of convict discipline, and the waved of lnnuiiierible punishments w ishcd over linn John Re\\ Hittered himself that bo had u-iuipcd tho name of one who w is ni f ict no living mm, uid tint unless one could ribo ii oin the de id, Richaid Devine would never return t> accuse lum So II ittenng himself, he giadu lily became bolder, and bj slow degrees suffered bia true nature to appear He w as violent to the servants, cruel to dogs and horses, often w antonly coarse in speech and brutally regardless of the feelings of others Governed, like most women, solely by hei feelings, Lady Devino had nt first been prodigil of her affection to the man �ho believed to bo her injured son But his nsh acts of helfnliuess, his habits of grossness and �elf indulgence gradually disgusted her For some time she-poor woman-fought against this feeling endeavoring to overcome her in stincts of distaste, and arguing with herself that to thus permit II detestation of her unfortunate son to arise in her heart was almost criminal, but BIIC MHB at length forced to succumb 

 Tor the hist year or so, Mr Richard conducted himsolf with great propnetj, but as his circle of acqu untance became enlarged,and Ins confidence m lnni�elf increased, he now and then forgot the part he was playing One day Mr Richaid went out to pass the d ly with a sporting friend only too proud to see at his table so wealthy and vvondeifnl a man Mr Richard drank i good deal more than was good for him, and came home in a condition of disgusting drunkeunei-s I say disgusting, because Borne folk have tho art of getting drunk in a humorous method, that robs intoxication of half ita grossness A man of true gentlemanly instincts, when owning a brain not weakened by habitual indulgence, never displ ij s those instincts to better adv an tage til m when overtaken in his cups With John Ret, to be drunk was to bo himself-coarse and cruel i rancis Wado was aw av, and Lady Devine had retired for the iiiCjht, when the dogcart deposited " Mr Richard Tho virtuous butler porter, who opened the door, received a blow in the chest and a demand for " Brandy I The groom was cursed, and ordered to instant oblivion Mr Richard stumbled into the dining room-veiled m that dun light which the servants considered nece�sarj for a dining room which was as it were, "sitting up for its master-and ordered "More candles1' The candles were brought, aftes some delaj, and Mr Richard amused linn self by spilling their meltings upon the di pet "Let's have luminashonl he oneil, and climbing with muddy boots upon the costly chairs, scrap mg with his feet the polished table, attempted to fix tho wax in the silver sconces, with which the antiquarian tastes of Mr Francis Wade had 

 adorned the room 

 " You 11 break the table, Pir,' said the servant "D- the table . ' said Rex "Buy nother table What's table t'y ou � ' 

 " Oh, certainly, sir," replied the man 

 " Oh c crt'nly ' Why c ertn ly ? What do you know about it ? ' 

 " Oh, certainly not, sir," replied the man 

 " If I had-stockvv hip here-I make you-hie -skip I Whar'B brandy ! '

 "Have some ! Good brandy ! Send for ser vautsh aud have dance D you dance, Tomkins � 

 " No, Mr Richard " 

 " Then you shall dance now, Tomkms You li dance upon nothing one day, Tomkms I Here I Halloo I Mary ' Susan ' Janet f William I Hey I Halloo I ' And he began to shout and blas- pheme 

 "Dont you think it's time for bed, Mr Richard � ' one of the men ventured to suggest 

 "No1' roared the ox convict, emphatically, "I don't I I've gone to bed at daylight far too long We 11 have luminashon I I m master here Master everything Richard 'Vine's my name Isn't it, Tomkins, you villain ? ' 

 " Oh h h I Ye yes, Mr Richard "

 ' Lady Devine has gone to bed, Mr Richard," cries Tomkius, aghast, attempting to bar tho passage to the upper regions 

 " Then lets hw o her out o' bed," erics John Rex, plunging to the door 

 " lotnkins, attempting to restrain lum, is instantly hurled niton cabinet of uro china, and the drunken brute essays the sturs The other servants seize lum Ho curse� aud fights like a donjon Doors bang open, lights gleam, maids hov cr, horrified, asking if it s " Bro, and begging to bo " put out The whole house is in an uproar , in the midst of vvh ch Lady Devine appears, and looks dow n upon the seeito Rev catches sight of her, and buists into blisphemj Sho vv ithdraw s, strangely terrified , and tho animal, torn, bloody, and blaspliomoiiB, IB at last got into his own aiartments, the groom, whoso face has been seriously damaged in the encounter, bestowing a hearty kick on the proatnto carcass at parting

 " I am afraid I was a little overcome by vvino last night, ' said he to Tomkms 

 ' Well, you was, sir, siys Tomkins 

 " Ah 1 A very little vv me makes me quite ill, Tomkins Did I do anything very violent ! '

 " What a fool I am,' thought John Ror, as he dresBed "I Bhall spoil everything if I don't tako care ' He was right He was going the right way to spoil overythmg However, for this bout he made amends-money soothed the ser- vants' hall, mid apologies and time won Lady Ellmor'8 forgiveness

 Lady Elhnor-with n sense of relief for which B1IB bl imed herself-assented, and, supplied w ith letters of credit, John Rex went to Pans 

 Fairly started m the world of dissipation and excess, ho bog m to grow reckless When a young man ho had been singularly free from the vice of drunkenness , turning hu sobriety-as he did all his vu tues-to vicious account, but he had learnt to di ink deep in tho loneliness of tho bush Master of a large sum of money, ho had intended to spend it as he w ould havo Bpont it in hiB younger days He had forgotten that since his death and burial the world had not grown youngei It vv as possible that Mi Lionel Ciof 

 ton might hni e dtscov eretl some of the old sot of fools and knaves w ith whom ho had onco mixed Many of thom w ero ahv e ind flourishing Mr Lemoine, for inst mee, was respectably married in his nativ e lal mil of Jersey, and had already threatened to disinherit a nephew who show ed a tendency to rake 

 But Mi Loinoino would not care to recoginso Mr Lionel Crofton, the gambler and rake, in his propel person, and it vv is not cvpediont that his acquaintance should be made in tho pel son of Richard Devine, lest by some unlucky chance ho should recoginso tho cheat Thus poor Lionel Crofton vv as compelled to lio still m his grave, and Mr Richard Dev me, trusting to a big beard and more burly figure, to keep his secret, vv as compelled to begin his friendship with Mr Lionels whilom filends nil over nguiu But m Pans and London there w ere plenty of people ready to become hail fellow well mot with any gentleman possessing money Mr llichnul De v ine'a straugo history was secretly whispered in many a boudoir and club room Hie history, howev er, was not atway s told m tho B uno way It w as generally known that Lady Dev ine had a son vv ho, being supposed to bo dead, had sud donly returned, to the confusion of Ins family But the manner of his return was told m many 

 ways 

 lu tho first place, Mi Trana� Wade, well known though ho was, did not mov e in th it brilliant circlo winch lind lately received his nephew T hero are in England many men of fortune as largo as that left by the old ship builder, who are positively unknown ni that little woild H huh ii supposed to contain all the men woi th knowing limcis Wade w is a man of mark m his own coterie Among artists, bi ic � biac kellets, antiquarians, and men of lettcis, he w as knott n as a p itron mid a m m of t �te His bankeis and his lawyers knew him to bo of inde pendent fortune, but as ho neither nn\\cd in polities, " went into society," betted, oi specu latid jn merchandise, then woro several lirLe sections of the community who had iievei heat d hu name Mnny rcspectible money lenders would hav o required " further information befoic tiley would discount his billa, and " club men in general-save peihapa those ancient quidnuncs who know everybody from Adam downwards-had but little acquaintinco with him Tho advent of Mi Richard Devine-a coarse person of unlimited means-had thei ef oro chief influence upon that sinister circle of m lio and fern ile rogues who foi m tho "half world 

 They bogan lo enquire concerning his antece dents, and, fulling satisfactory information, to invent lies coneeinmg him It was generally believed that he w as a black sheep, a mau w hoso family kept him out of the way, but who was, in a pecuniary sense, " good ' for a considerable 

 sum 

 Thus taken upon tiust, Mr Richard Devino mixed in the very best of bad society, and had no lack of agreeable friends to help lum to spend his money So admirably did ho spend it, that Francis Wade became lit last alarmed at thi fro quent drafts, and urged his nephew to bring his 

 afiairsto a final settlement Richard Devine-in Paris, or Homburg or London, or elsewhere could nevir bo got to attack business, and Mr Francis Wade Lrew more and more anxious Tho

 Mi Wade began to repent of his too eai,y taking of matter� m the beginning Not that he had a suspicion of Rev, but that ho remembered that Dick was always a loose fish The even durent of the dilettante � life became disturbed 

 He j,i evv i ale and hollow eyed His digestion vv is impaired Ile ceased to tiko tint interest m china which the importance of that irticle de minded In a word, ho grew despondent as to Ins fitness for his mission in life Lady Elhnor saw a great chance in her bri thcr He became morose, peevish, excitable Sho weut puvitely to the family doctor, who shrugged his shoulders "There is no dangei, said he, "if he is kept quiet, keep him quiet, and ho will live for years, but his fatliei died of heart due fe, you know Lady Elhnor, upon this, wrote a long letter to Mr Richard, who was at Paris, repe itcd tho doctors opinion, and begged him tocomeovci at once Mr Richard replied that some boree racing matter of great importance occupied his attention, but that he would be at his rooms in Clarges streit (he had long established a town house) on the 14th, and would " go into matters ' " I have lost a good deal of money lately, my dear mother, aaid Mr Richard, "and the present wall be a good opportunity to make a final settlement ' The fact was, that John Rex, now three years m undisturbed possession, con- sidered that the moment lind arrived for the execution of his �/rand coup-the carrying off at one swoop of the whole of the fortune he hod gambled for

 Extracted from the Diary of the Rc> James North 

 MAI 12-Landed to day at Norfolk Island, and have been introduced to my new abode, Bituated some 1100 miles from Sydney A Bohtary rock m the tropical ocean, the island seems, indeed, a fit place of banishment It is about seven miles long and four broad The most remarkable natural object is of course the Norfolk Island pine, which rears its stately head a hundred feet above the surrounding forest 

 The appearance of the place is very wild and beautiful, bringing to my mind tho description of the romantic islands of the Pacific, which old geographers dwell upon so fondly Lemon, lime, and guava treeB abound, also oranges, grapes, figs, bananas, peaches, pomegranates, and pineapples The climate just now is hot and muggy The approach to Kingstown-as tho barracks and huts aro called-is properly diflicult A long low reef-probably originally a portion of tho barren rocks of Nepean and Philip Islands, which 

 rise east and west of the settlement-fronts the bay and obstructs the entrance of v csscls Wo were landed m boats through an opening in this rcof, and our vessel stands on mid oil within signalling distance Iho surf washes almost ngnmst the walls of the military road way tli it leads to the barracks The soci ii aspect of tho place fills mo with horror 'Iheio sectus neither disciplino nor order On our way to tho Com mandants house we passed a low dilapidated building where the men were at work y Hiding maize, and at the Bight of us tiley commenced whistling, hooting, and shouting, using tho mi st disgustiug language 1 hrco warders w ero near, but no attempt was mode to check this nu seemly exhibition

 An occuirenco tojk place tina morning which BIIOWS the dingerous condition of the "Ring ' I accompained Mr P nineo to tho Lumber Yiud, nnd, on our entry, wo observed a man in the crowd round tho cook house deliberately amok ing The Chief Constable of the lal uid-my old friend Troke, of Port Arthui-boeing that this exhibition attrictcd Pounce s notice, pointed out tho man to au assistant Tho assistant, Jacob Gunblett, advanced and desued the pusoner to surrender the pipe The man plunged his liiinds into his pockets, and, with i gesture of tho ioost profound contempt, walked away to th it part of the mo3s shed where the " Ring con�,re�ate 

 " Take the scjundrel to gaol ' onus lioke 

 No one moved, but tho man at the gato that lends through tho enrpenter� shop into the barracks, called to us to come out, Baj log th it the prisoners would never suffer the man to be taken. Pouuce, however, with nure dctormina tion than I fcavc lum credit for, kept his ground, and insisted that so flagrant a breach of disciplino should not be suffered to pasa unnoticed Thus urged, Mr Troko pushed through tho crowd, and made for the spot whither the man had 

 withdrawn himself 

 The yard was now buzzing like a disturbed hive, and I momentarily expected that a rush would be made upon us In a few moments the prisoner appeared, attended by, rather than in 

 the custody of, the Chief Constable of the island He advanced to the unlucky assistant constable, who was standing close to me, and asked, " What have you ordered mo to gaol for ? ' The man made some reply advising him to go quietly, when the convict raised his fist and deliberately felled the man to the ground 

 " You had better retire, gentlemen," says Troke " I BOO them getting out their kmv es 

 We mode for tho gate, and tho crowd closed in like a sea upon the two constables I full} expected murder, but m a few moments Troko and Gimblett appeared, bomo along by a mass of men, dusty, but unbanned, and having the 

 couv ict between them He sulkily raised a hand il as ho passed mc, either to rectify the position of y lus straw hat, or to offer a tartly apology A more wanton, unprovoked, and flagrant outrage thin that of which this mm waB guilty I nevci vv ltnessed It is customary foi "tho old dog-*

 as ho had done 

 Phis is the same man, then, whom I injured at Port Arthur Sov cu years of " discipline
