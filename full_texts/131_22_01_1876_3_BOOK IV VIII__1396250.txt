 THE LONOLST STHAW 

 Rufus Dawes hearing, when "on tho chain' 

 tho ne\\t day, of the wanton torture of his friend uttered no threat of vengeance, but troaned only " I am not so strong ub I was," sud he, is if in apology for his lack of Bpirit 1 lhey have unnericd me" And ho looked 

 sully down at his gaunt flame and trembling 

 binds 

 I can t stand it no longer," said Mooney, grimly Ive spoken to Blnud, and he s of my mind \\ ou know what we resolved to do Lets 

 do it 

 Rufus Dnwes stared at tho sightless oibs turned enquiringly to his own Tho fingers of his hand, thrust into his bosom, felt a token which lay there A shudder thrilled him No, no N ot now, ho said 

 ' You re not afeard, man ?" asked Mooney, stretching out his hand m the dnection of tho voice ' Youie not going to shirk?' The othei avoided the touch, and Bhrank away, still staring "You tin't going to back out after vou sworded it, Dwes . You're not that sort Danes, speak, man ! ' 

 ' Is Bland willing?' asked Dawes, looking round, is if to seek some method of escape from the glare of those unspeculntive eyes 

 Ui and reidy They flogged him again

 ' Leave it till tomorrow," said Dawes, at 

 length ' 

 'No , lets have it over," urged the old mun, 

 with a strange eagerness" "I am tired o' 

 this 

 RufuB Dawes cast a wistful glance tow ards the wall behind which lay the hoiiBO of the Commandant "Leave it till tomorrow," he 

 repeated, with his hand still m hiB breast 

 They had been so occupied in their conversa tion that neither hud observed the approach of their common enemy " What aro you hiding tuero � erics I rere, seizing Dawes by the wrist 

 �ore tobacco, you dog?' The hand of the convict, thus suddenly plucked from his bosom, opened involuntarily, and a withered rose fell to tne earth Krcro at once, mdignaut and astonished, picked it up "Hallo I What tho oeviis this? a, ou\\e not beeu robbing my garden for a nosegay, Jack?' The Com- mandant was wont to call all convicts " Jack " in ins moments of facetiousness It was a little humorous way he had

 The gang, left to itself for a moment, bestowed their atteution upon Dawes Large tears were silently rolling down his face, and he stood staring at tho wall as ono m a dream The gang curled then lips One fellow, moro charitable than tho rest, tapped his fore head and winked " He s going cranky, ' said this good natural man, who could not understand what a Bano prisoner had todo with flowers D uves �ecoicred himself, and tho contemptuous glances of Ins companions seemed to bung back the color to his cheeks " W e 11 do it to ui{,ht, 

 whispered ho to Mooney, and Mooney smiled 

 with pleasure 

 Since the ' tobacco tuck, Mooney and Dawes had been placed in the new prison, together with a mau named Bland, who had alreidy twico fulled to killlnmsolf When old Mooney, flesh fiom the torture of tho gig and bridle, lamented his hard case Bland proposed that the thrco should put in practice a schemo m w Inch, tvv o at least must succeed The schemo w as a despci ato one, and attempted but in the last extremity It was the custom of the Riug, howevei, to swear each of its membeis to carry out to the best of his ability this last invention of the convict disciplined mmd, should two othci membeis 

 crav e his assistance 

 The scheme-liko all great ideas-was sim phcity itself 

 That ev oinng, when the coll door was securely locked, and tho absence of a visiting gaoler might bo counted upon for au houi at least, Bland pro duced a straw, and held it out to his companions Dnwestook it,andteanng ltinto unequal lengths, handed the fragments to Mooney " The longest is the one, said the blind man " Come on, boy s, and dip m the lucky bag ' It was ev ident that 

 lots vi oro to be drawn to deteimme to whom fortune would grant freedom The mon drew m Bileuce, and then Bl lud and Dawes looked at each other The pii�e had been left in the big Mooney-fortunato old fellow-retained tho longest sti iw Bland s" hand shook as he coin pnred notes with his companion Thero w as a moments pause, during winch the blank eye balls of the blind man fiei eely searched the gloom, as if in that awful moment they could peuetiato 

 it 

 " I hold tho shortest, ' said Daw eB to Bland " Tis y ou that must do it 

 "Im glad of that, said Mooney 

 Bland, seemingly terrified at the dinger which fate bael deei eed that ho should run, tore tho fatal lot into fragments, with au oath, and sat gnawing Ins knuckles m excess of abject teiror Mooney stiotched himself out upon his plank bed " Come on, mate, he said 

 Bland extended i sinking hand and caught Rufus Dawes by the sleeve "You have molo 

 non o than I You do it 

 "No, no,' says Dawes, almost na pale na his companion " 1 v o run my chanco fairly Tw as youi ovv n proposal ' 

 Hie coward who, confident m his own luck, would seem to have f dieu into the pit ho had dug for others, Bat rocking himself to and fro, holding his head m his hands " By Heav cn, I cant do it, he whispered, lifting a white, wet 

 face 

 " What aro you waiting foi t ' said fortunato Mooney " Como on, I m ready ' 

 " I-I-thought ^ ou nuglit liko to-to-pi ay a bit, sayfl Bland 

 The notion seemed to sober tho senses of the old man, exalted too horcoly by his good foi tune " Ayo, ho said " Pi ay ! A good thought I 

 aud ho kuelt down, and shutting lus blmd ey es - tvv as as though ho vvnsdnzzled by somo6tioiig light, unseen by his comrades-mov ed his lips silently 

 The silence was at last biokcn by the footstep of tho warder in the coi udor Bland hailed it as a reprieve from whatever act of daring lie dreaded "Wo must wait until he goes, lie whispered eagerly " He might look in Dawes nodded, and Mooney, whoso quick car appusid lum voi y exactly of the position of the appioaeh rug gaoler, lose from his knees, radi mt Tho som faco of Gnnblett appen ed at the trap of tho cell doo! "All light? ho asked, aoniowhat -bo the thiee thought-less sourly than usual "All rifcht, v\\as tho reply and Mooney added "Good night, Mr Gnnblett " I wonder what makes tho old man so cheerful, thought Gimb lett, as ho got into the ne\\t coi i idor 

 Tho Bound of his echoing footsteps had scarcely died away, when upon tho ears of the two less fortunato castei s of lots, fell tho dull sonn I of rending woollen The lucky man was teaiing a stup ft oin his blanket 1 think this will do, 

 said he, pulling it between Ins hands to test its strength " I am an old man It was possible that ho debated conccruniL, the descent of soinu abyss into which the stup of blanket was to low oi lum "Here, Bland catch hold YWieio ai o ye ?-don t bo faint hearted, mau It w on t take y e long ' 

 It was quite dark now ni tho cell, but as Bland advanced, his face seemed a white m isk floating upon tho daikuess, it was so ghastly pale Dawes picssed Ins lucky comrades hand and withdraw to the farthest corner Bland and Mooney seemed for n few moments occupiod w ith the rope-doubtless pi epanng foi escape by means of it The silence was broken only by tho convulsive y angling of Bland s nous-bo was shuddeung violently At last Mooney spoke again, in stiaugely soft and subdued tones 

 " Dawes, lad, do you think there is a Heaven? " I know there is a Hell, saul Dawes, with out turning his face 

 " Ay, and a Heaven, lad I think I shall go theie You will, old chap for you ve boen good to me-God bless you, you v e been v ery good to 

 When Troke carno in the morning he saw what had occurred at a glance, and hastened to remove the corpse of the strangled Mooney 

 ' We drew lots, said Rufus Dawes, pointing to Bland, who crouched in the corner farthest from his victim, " and it fell upon him to do it 

 I na the witness " 

 " They 11 hang you for all that,' said Troke " I hopo bo, said Rufus Dawes 

 The scheme of escape hit upon by the conv ict intellect was simply this Three men being to gother, lots were drawn to detcimine whom should be murdered The drawer of the longest straw was the "lucky man He was killed The drawer of the next longest straw was the murderer He was hanged The unlucky one was tho witness He had, of course, an excellent chance of being hung also, but his doom was not so certain, and he therefore looked upon lumBelf 

 as unfortunate

 Johv Rex found the George disagreeably pre pared for his arrival Obsequious waiters flew to rescue his dressing bag and over coat, the land lord himself welcomed him at the door Two naval gentlemen carno out of tho coffee room to Btare at him " Have you any moro luggage, Mr Devine ? asked the landlord, as he flung open the door of the best drawing room It was awkwardly evident that his wife had no notion of suffering him to hide his borrowed light

 A supper table hid for tvv o people gleamed bright from the cheeriest corner A fire crackled beneath the marble mantelshelf The latest evening paper lay upon a chair , and, bruBlung it carelessly with her costly silks, the w oman he had so basely deserted came smiling to meet

 " Well, Mr Richard Devine,' said she, "you did not expect to seo mo again, did you ? 

 Although, on his journey down, he had com posed an elaborate speech wherewith to greet her, this unnatural civility dumfounded him 

 "SarahI I never meant to-" 

 " Hush, my dear Richard-it must be Richard now, I suppose- this is not the time for explana tions Besides, the waiter might hear you Let us have some supper now, you must be hungry, I am sure ' He advanced to the table mechani-

 He was about toTitter some imprecation, but she stopped him by aglanee " No bad language, John, or I sholl ring for a constable Let us understand one another, my dear Yrou may be a v ery great man to other people, but to me y ou are merely my runaway huBband-an escaped convict, li you don t eat your supper civilly, I shall certainly send for the police ' 

 " Sarah ! ' he burst out, " I never meant to desert you Upon tay word It is all a mistake Let me explain " 

 " There is no need for explanations yet, Jack -I mean Richard Hav e your supper Ah 1 I know what you want " 

 She poured out half a tumbler of brandy, and gave it to him Ho took the glass from her bund, drank the contents, and then, as though warmed by tho spirit, laughed " What a woman you are, Sarih I h ive been a great bruto, I confers 

 "You bavo been an ungrateful villain, said she, with sudden passion, "a hardened, selfish 

 villain 

 " But, Sarah, " Don t touch mo I ' 

 " 'Pon my word, you aro a fine creature, and I was a fool to le no you ' 

 The comj luuent seemed to sootlio hor, for nor tone changed somcw hat " It w as i w �cked, cruel act, Jick You whom I saved from eleiith -whom I nursed-whom I enuehed It was the act of a cow ard
